good of the institution But this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation The second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy between faculty members who are part of the in-group that owns and operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees is therefore the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself This is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure Yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in order The first is a negative warning there is no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory boards with high-sounding titles but no real authority In the case of academic personnel the feeling of participation can hardly be faked Competent teachers are well versed in the technique of leading students to pre-set conclusions without destroying the students' illusion that they are making their own decisions Those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to be taken in by busy-work and ersatz decision making In any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at all In the Notre Dame report reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to luncheon-table communication In itself there is nothing wrong with this form of participation the only difficulty on the Catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position to implement policy i.e. members of the religious community which owns and administers the institution have their own eating arrangements Sen. John L. McClellan of Arkansas and Rep. David Martin of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws Once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions the law must treat everybody equally Or in the words of Anatole France The law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich as well as the poor from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges The public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of Mr. McClellan's hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and later into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites The Senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program In addition disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing the bill It is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages but he pays the employers' strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike Business Week Aug. 9 1961 reports that the United Aircraft Company against which the International Association of Machinists had undertaken a strike decided to keep its plants operating The company incurred some million of expenses attributable to four factors advertising to attract new employees hiring and training them extra overtime and defective work performed by the new workers The company has billed the United States Government for of these expenses under the Defense Department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractor's business Rep. Frank Kowalski of Connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the Armed Services Committee The committee remains unresponsive Neither has Congressman Martin nor Senator McClellan been heard from on the matter they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unions The recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the anti-trust laws that is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained The anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete but along completely undefined lines it must play a game in which there never is a winner The fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the law Hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy Let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods industry in which General Electric Westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market The industry is so structured that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocated whether marginal or average pricing is applied The problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment Accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price Naturally enterprises of the size of General Electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time Should these giants really flex their competitive muscles they would become the only survivors in the industry Uncle Sam would then accuse them of creating a monopoly by unfair competition But if they show self-restraint they don't get the orders Under the circumstances the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convicted Engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants The paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government after the conviction that General Electric sign a wide-open consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows In other words the anti-trust laws designed to reduce prices to the consumer on Monday Wednesday and Friday become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on Tuesday Thursday and Saturday And which theory would govern the enforcers of the law on Sunday The question might be asked Don't the managements of the heavy-electrical-goods manufacturers know these facts Why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be good boys thereafter expressing their complete confidence in the laws The past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to management was explained by Thurman Arnold in The Folklore of Capitalism back in 1937 He wrote P. 211 the anti-trust laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need of great organizations and at the same time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure P. 214 anti-trust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship P. 215 when corporate abuses were attacked it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked rather than control In this manner every scheme for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the anti-trust laws Pp. 228-229 in any event it is obvious that the anti-trust laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial empires the world has ever known held together by some of the most fantastic ideas all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government This escape from control has led to management's evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as worth while A plea of nolo contendere followed by a nominal fine after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license The penalties handed out in the electrical case which included jail sentences were unprecedented in anti-trust prosecutions perhaps because the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing activities If a substitute mechanism is needed for the control of a fictitious impersonal market quite obviously some method must be devised for representing the public interest A secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle However one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti-trust laws are effective and rational Quite clearly the anti-trust laws are neither effective nor rational and yet the argument goes that they should be extended to the labor union Those who favor placing trade unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform Before 1933 individuals who opposed trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain English The acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934 implicit in the writing of Section 7A of the National Industrial Recovery Act has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principle The Wagner Act the Taft-Hartley Act and the Landrum-Griffin Act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining The basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system is the removal of wages from competition If a union cannot perform this function then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers as a gigantic fraud The tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession The problem must be faced squarely If laborers are merely commodities competing against each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat and corn unsupported by the way by any agricultural subsidy then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status upon them Human labor was exactly that a commodity in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century America As early as 1776 Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth Of Nations We have no acts of Parliament against combining to lower the price of work but many against combining to raise it Eighteenth-century England upon whose customs our common law was built had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies In 1825 the Boston house carpenters' strike for a ten-hour day was denounced by the organized employers who declared It is considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to effect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into monopolies There were no pious hypocrisies then about being for collective bargaining but against labor monopoly The courts shared the opinion of the employers In People vs. Fisher Justice Savage of the New York Supreme Court declared Without any officious and improper interference on the subject the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid for it but the right does not exist to raise the wages of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means Compare this statement of a nineteenth-century judge with how Congressman Martin according to the Daily Labor Report of Sept. 19 1961 defends the necessity of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of labor if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages hours and conditions of employment Senator McClellan is proposing the application of anti-trust measures to unions in transportation His bill allegedly aimed at Hoffa would amend the Sherman Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia acts to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert with any other union even a sister local in the same international Paradoxically the same week in which Senator McClellan was attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation the Civil Aeronautics Board was assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel the action would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act Indeed it is in the field of transportation that Congress has most frequently granted employers exemption from the anti-trust laws for example the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergers At the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality of anti-trust legislation a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws to unions who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight rates The passage of the Sherman Act was aimed at giant monopolies It was most effective against trade unions In the famous Danbury Hatters case a suit was brought against the union by the Loewe Company for monopolistic practices e.g. trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturer The suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment In 1914 the Clayton Act attempted to take labor out from under the anti-trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be considered a commodity The law could not suspend economics Labor remained a commodity but presumably a privileged one granted immunization from the anti-trust laws The courts by interpretation emasculated the act In 1922 the United Mine Workers struck the Coronado Coal Company The company sued under the anti-trust laws alleging that the union's activity interfered with the movement of interstate commerce What other purpose could a striking union have but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise The court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference with commerce The nation the three-front war At a closed-door session on Capitol Hill last week Secretary of State Christian Herter made his final report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on U.S. affairs abroad Afterward Tennessee's Democratic Senator Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen What Herter presented said Gore was not a very encouraging review That was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the West and Communism erupted on three fronts While Communists were undermining United Nations efforts to rescue the Congo from chaos two other Communist offensives stirred the Eisenhower Administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions 1 Cuba Hours after a parade of his new Soviet tanks and artillery Dictator Fidel Castro suddenly confronted the U.S. with a blunt and drastic demand within 48 hours the U.S. had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in Cuba to a total of eleven persons the embassy staff alone totaled 87 U.S. citizens plus 120 Cuban employees President Eisenhower held an 8:30 a.m. meeting with top military and foreign-policy advisers decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately There is a limit to what the United States in self-respect can endure said the President That limit has now been reached Through Secretary Herter Ike offered President-elect Kennedy an opportunity to associate his new Administration with the breakoff decision Kennedy through Secretary-designate of State Dean Rusk declined He thus kept his hands free for any action after Jan. 20 although reaction to the break was generally favorable in the U.S. and Latin America see the hemisphere 2 Laos After a White House huddle between the President and top lieutenants the Defense Department reacted sharply to a cry from the pro-Western government of Laos that several battalions of Communist troops had invaded Laos from North Viet Nam In view of the present situation in Laos said the Pentagon's announcement we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase the readiness of our forces in the Pacific Cutting short a holiday at Hong Kong the aircraft carriers Lexington and Bennington steamed off into the South China Sea accompanied by a swarm of destroyers plus troopships loaded with marines On the U.S.'s island base of Okinawa Task Force 116 made up of Army Navy Marine and Air Force units got braced to move southward on signal But by week's end the Laotian cry of invasion was read as an exaggeration see foreign news and the U.S. was agreeing with its cautious British and French allies that a neutralist rather than a pro-Western government might be best for Laos French Indians There was a moral of sorts in the Laotian situation that said much about all other cold-war fronts Political economic and military experts were all agreed that chaotic mountainous little Laos was the last place in the world to fight a war and they were probably right It would be like fighting the French and Indian War all over again said one military man But why was Laos the new Southeast Asian battleground At Geneva in 1954 to get the war in Indo-China settled the British and French gave in to Russian and Communist Chinese demands and agreed to the setting up of a Communist state North Viet Nam which then predictably became a base for Communist operations against neighboring South Viet Nam and Laos The late Secretary of State John Foster Dulles considered the 1954 Geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement saw that resolution would be needed to keep it from becoming a calamity for the West He began the diplomatic discussions that resulted in the establishment of Aj The important thing from now on he said is not to mourn the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern Viet Nam from leading to the extension of Communism throughout Southeast Asia Russian tanks and artillery parading through the streets of Havana Russian intrigue in the Congo and Russian arms drops in Laos using the same Ilyushin transports that were used to carry Communist agents to the Congo made it plain once more that the cold war was all of a piece in space and time Soviet Premier Khrushchev sent New Year's hopes for peace to President-elect Kennedy and got a cool acknowledgment in reply Considering the state of the whole world the cold war's three exposed fronts did not seem terribly ominous but in Senator Gore's words it was not a very encouraging situation that would confront John F. Kennedy on Inauguration Day The Congress turmoil in the House As the 87th Congress began its sessions last week liberal Democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled by the House Rules Committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation to the floor The liberal pressure bloc which coyly masquerades under the name Democratic Study Group had fought the committee before and had always lost This time they were much better prepared and organized and the political climate was favorable They had the unspoken support of President-elect Kennedy whose own legislative program was menaced by the Rules Committee bottleneck And counting noses they seemed to have the votes to work their will Deadly deadlock There were two possible methods of breaching the conservative barriers around the Rules Committee 1 to pack it with additional liberals and break the conservative-liberal deadlock or 2 to remove one of the conservatives namely Mississippi's 14-term William Meyers Colmer pronounced Calmer Caucusing the liberals decided to go after Colmer which actually was the more drastic course since seniority in the House is next to godliness A dour gangling man with a choppy gait Colmer looks younger than his 70 years has gradually swung from a moderate internationalist position to that of a diehard conservative He is generally and initially suspicious of any federal project unless it happens to benefit his Gulf Coast constituents He is of course a segregationist but he says he has never made an anti-Negro speech For 20 years he has enjoyed his power on the Rules Committee There his vote along with those of Chairman Howard Smith the courtly Virginia judge and the four Republican members could and often did produce a 6-6 deadlock that blocked far-out Democratic-sponsored welfare legislation a tactic often acceptable to the Rayburn-Johnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing votes Equal treatment There was sufficient pretext to demand Colmer's ouster he had given his lukewarm support to the anti-Kennedy electors in Mississippi Reprisals are not unheard of in such situations but the recent tendency has been for the Congress to forgive its prodigal sons In 1949 the Dixiecrats escaped unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against Harry Truman and in 1957 after Congressman Adam Clayton Powell campaigned for Dwight Eisenhower in 1956 his fellow Democrats did not touch his committee assignments although they did strip him temporarily of his patronage In the heat of the anti-Colmer drive last week Judge Smith threatened reprisal against Powell Said he We will see whether whites and Negroes are treated the same around here But Speaker Sam Rayburn after huddling in Palm Beach with President-elect Kennedy decided that this year something had to be done about the Rules Committee and that he was the only man who could do anything effective In a tense closed-door session with Judge Smith Rayburn attempted to work out a compromise to add three new members to the Rules Committee two Democrats including one Southerner and one Republican Smith flatly rejected the offer and Mister Sam thereupon decided to join the rebels The next morning he summoned a group of top Democrats to his private office and broke the news he would lead the fight to oust Colmer whom he is said to regard as an inferior man News of Rayburn's commitment soon leaked out When Missouri's Clarence Cannon got the word he turned purple Unconscionable He shouted and rushed off to the Speaker's Room to object A dangerous precedent Cannon a powerful conservative man brought welcome support to the Smith-Colmer forces as chairman of the Appropriations Committee he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding this or that congressional district from federal pork-barrel projects Sitting quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another Judge Smith ally Georgia's Carl Vinson chairman of the Armed Services Committee Threat of war As the battle raged in the cloakrooms and caucuses it became clear that Judge Smith could lose His highest count of supporters numbered 72 and he needed nearly twice that number to control the 260-member Democratic caucus The liberals smelling blood were faced with the necessity of winning three big votes in the Democratic Committee on Committees in the full party caucus and on the floor of the House before they could oust Colmer One big question If Colmer was to be purged what should the House do about the other three senior Mississippians who supported the maverick electors In all three arenas they seemed certain of victory especially with Sam Rayburn applying his whiplash But in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter of losing a costlier war If the Southerners were sufficiently aroused they could very well cut the Kennedy legislative program to ribbons from their vantage point of committee chairmanships leaving Sam Rayburn leading a truncated unworkable party With that possibility in mind Arkansas' Wilbur Mills deliberately delayed calling a meeting of the Committee on Committees and coolheaded Democrats sought to bring Rayburn and Smith together again to work out some sort of face-saving compromise Here are two old men mad at each other and too proud to pick up the phone said a House Democratic leader One wants a little more power and the other doesn't want to give up any Battle in the senate The Senate launched the 87th Congress with its own version of an ancient liberal-conservative battle but in contrast with the House's guerrilla war it seemed as pro forma as a Capitol guide's speech Question at issue How big a vote should be necessary to restrict Senate debate and thereby cut off legislation-delaying filibusters A wide-ranging bipartisan force from Minnesota's Democratic Hubert Humphrey to Massachusetts' Republican Leverett Saltonstall was drawn up against a solid phalanx of Southern Democrats who have traditionally used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills New Mexico's Clint Anderson offered a resolution to change the Senate's notorious Rule 22 to allow three-fifths of the Senators present and voting to cut off debate instead of the current hard-to-get two-thirds Fair Dealer Humphrey upped the ante asked cloture power for a mere majority of Senators Georgia's Dick Russell objected politely and the battle was joined Privately the liberals admitted that the Humphrey amendment had no chance of passage Privately they also admitted that their hopes for Clint Anderson's three-fifths modification depended on none other than Republican Richard Nixon In 1957 Nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of Senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new Congress and that any rules laid down by previous Congresses were not binding Armed with the Nixon opinion the Senate liberals rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate on the filibuster battle this week Hopefully the perennial battle of Rule 22 then would be fought to a settlement once and for all Republicans last act Since Election Day Vice President Richard Nixon had virtually retired by his own wish from public view But with the convening of the new Congress he was the public man again presiding over the Senate until John Kennedy's Inauguration One day last week Nixon faced a painful constitutional chore that required him to officiate at a joint session of Congress to hear the official tally of the Electoral College vote and then to make sufficient declaration of the election of the man who defeated him in the tight 1960 presidential election Nixon fulfilled his assignment with grace then went beyond the required sufficient declaration This is the first time in 100 years that a candidate for the presidency announced the result of an election in which he was defeated he said The Masters golf tournament proved last Monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves Gary Player the small trim South African was the eventual winner but in all his 25 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap Arnold Palmer the defending champion lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief Just when you think you have it licked this golf course can get up and bite you Player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament And that is just what happened on the last few holes The Augusta National Golf Club Course got up and bit both Player and Palmer Player was the first to feel its teeth After playing a splendid first nine holes in 34 two strokes under par on this fifth and final day of the tournament Sunday's fourth round had been washed out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed Player's game rapidly fell to pieces He bogeyed the 10th After a journey through woods and stream he double-bogeyed the 13th He bogeyed the 15th by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three holes without further mishap for a 2-over-par 74 and a 72-hole total of 280 As he signed his scorecard and walked off the course Player was almost in tears He could read on the nearby scoreboard that Palmer by then playing the 15th hole was leading him by a stroke Palmer had started the round four strokes behind Player and at one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes Now all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golf When Palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway on the 72nd hole he seemed to have the championship won But the seven-iron shot he used to approach the green strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression In trying to hit it out with a sand wedge Palmer bounced the ball over the green past spectators and down the slope toward a TV tower Afterwards Palmer told Charlie Coe his last-round partner that he simply played the hole too fast He did seem hasty on his second and third shots but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while Coe graciously putted out giving Palmer a chance to recover his composure which he had quite visibly lost When the shaken Palmer finally did hit his fourth shot he overshot the hole by 15 feet Palmer was now putting merely for a tie and Player who was sitting beside his wife and watching it all on television in Tournament Chairman Clifford Roberts' clubhouse apartment stared in amazement when Palmer missed the putt Palmer's 281 for the four rounds at Augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest pro but it was barely good enough for a second-place tie with Coe The lean and leathery Oklahoma amateur who has been playing topnotch tournament golf for many years refused to let the Masters jitters overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight 69 End at seven Until late last Saturday afternoon Palmer had played seven consecutive rounds of golf at the Masters four last year and three this without ever being out of first place As evening approached and Palmer finished his Saturday round with a disappointing one-over-par 73 this remarkable record was still intact thanks to his Thursday and Friday rounds of 68 and 69 His three-round total of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score a 213 by Bill Collins the tall and deliberate Baltimorean who had been playing very well all winter long But Palmer knew as did everybody else at Augusta that his streak was about to be broken Half an hour after he finished his round Player holed out at the 18th green with a 69 and a three-round total of 206 four strokes ahead of Palmer More than a streak had ended Long after the erratic climate and the washed-out final round on Sunday have become meteorological footnotes the 1961 Masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between Arnold Palmer and Gary Player Unlike most such sports rivalries it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously although this was not exactly the case When the winter tour began at Los Angeles last January there was no one in sight to challenge Palmer's towering prestige As if to confirm his stature he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments Player won only one But as the tour reached Pensacola a month ago Player was leading Palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars and the rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere On the final round at Pensacola the luck of the draw paired Palmer and Player in the same threesome and although it was far from obvious at the time the gallery was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come On that final Sunday at Pensacola neither Palmer nor Player was leading the tournament and as it turned out neither won it But whichever of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial leader of the tour Player immediately proved he was not in the least awed by the dramatic proximity of Palmer He outplayed Palmer all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to Palmer's 71 Thereafter until the Masters Player gradually increased his lead over Palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory at Miami When they reached Augusta last week together they had won five of the 13 tournaments to date Instant rivalry On Thursday the first day of the Masters the contest between Palmer and Player developed instantly It was a dismal drizzly day but a good one on which to score over the Augusta National course The usually skiddy greens were moist and soft so the golfers were able to strike their approach shots boldly at the flag-stick and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry about the consequences Palmer's 4-under-par 68 got him off to an early lead which he shared with Bob Rosburg But Player was only one stroke back with a 69 Even so it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever that this tournament was to be essentially a match between Palmer and Player A lot of people were still thinking about Jack Nicklaus the spectacular young amateur who had a 70 or Ken Venturi who had a somewhat shaky 72 but was bound to do better or Rosburg whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of Augusta's treacheries or even old Byron Nelson whose excellent 71 made one wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf On Thursday nobody except Charlie Coe was thinking of Charlie Coe On Friday a day as cloudless and lovely as Thursday had been gray and ugly the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus Rosburg had started early in the day and by the time Palmer and Player were on the course separated as they were destined to be for the rest of the weekend by about half an hour they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted around the course that Rosburg who ended with a 73 was not having a good day As Player began his second round in a twosome with amateur Bill Hyndman his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender Player began with a birdie on the first hole added five straight pars and then another birdie at the 9th On the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament He birdied the 13th the 15th and the 18th five birdies one bogey and 12 pars for a 68 Starting half an hour behind Player in company with British Open Champion Kel Nagle Palmer birdied the 2nd the 9th the 13th and the 16th four birdies one bogey and 13 pars for a 69 The roar of Palmer's gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out across the parklike landscape of Augusta only to be answered moments later by the roar of Player's gallery for a similar triumph At one point late in the day when Palmer was lining up a 25-foot putt on the 16th a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th green unmistakably announced that Player had birdied the final hole Without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed although he later admitted that he had Palmer proceeded to sink his 25-footer and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling back along the intervening fairways in reply The boldness of champions Anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing this most difficult golf course It is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots with a vehemence bordering on violence The bad luck that can so often mar a well-played round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous boldness of these champions Bob Jones played that way Byron Nelson did Hogan did And last week at the Masters Palmer and Player did As the third round of the tournament began on Saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest it was Player's superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead This day Palmer had started first As Player stepped on the first tee he knew that Palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was 2 under par for the day Player immediately proceeded to follow suit In fact he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well to go 4 under par for the first eight holes But Player's real test came on the ninth hole a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards He hit a poor tee shot pulling it off into the pine woods separating the 9th and first fairways Having hit one of the trees the ball came to rest not more than 160 yards out Player then had the choice of punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and settling for a bogey 5 or gambling The latter involved hitting a full four-wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse hoping to slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green I was hitting the ball well Player said later and I felt strong When you're playing like that you'd better attack Player attacked with his four-wood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever forget It struck the 9th green on the fly and stopped just off the edge From there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par 4 Palmer meanwhile had been having his troubles They started on the 4th hole a 220-yard par-3 On this day the wind had switched 180-degrees from the northwest to the southeast and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few days At the 4th tee Palmer chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood was the proper club so he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green His bogey 4 on this hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought him back to even par Starting the second nine Palmer was already four strokes behind Player and knew it When Mickey Charles Mantle the New York Yankees' man of muscle drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers his feat touches upon the sublime When Roger Eugene Maris Mantle's muscular teammate powers four home runs in a double-header his performance merits awe But when tiny 145-pound Albert Gregory Pearson of the Los Angeles Angels who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because as a teammate explained the other team thought no one was out there hits seven home runs in four months three more than his total in 1958 1959 and 1960 his achievement borders on the ridiculous This is Baseball 1961 This is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous It is the year when 1 amiable Jim Gentile of the Baltimore Orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and in unprecedented style delivered consecutive grand-slam home runs 2 Willie Mays of the San Francisco Giants borrowed a teammate's bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game 3 the Milwaukee Braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home runs in three games and lost two of them and 4 catcher Johnny Blanchard of the New York Yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat two of them as a pinch-hitter Pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats the shrinking strike zone and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegal Experts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the American League caused by expansion Whatever the reasons not in 30 years has a single season produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records home-run division Of all the records in peril one stands apart dramatic in its making dramatic in its endurance and now doubly dramatic in its jeopardy This of course is baseball's most remarkable mark The 60 home runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible epicure the incredible athlete George Herman Babe Ruth of the Yankees Since 1927 fewer than a dozen men have made serious runs at Babe Ruth's record and each in turn has been thwarted What ultimately frustrated every challenger was Ruth's amazing September surge In the final month of the 1927 season he hit seventeen home runs a closing spurt never matched Double threat Always in the abortive attacks upon Ruth's record one man alone a Jimmy Foxx 58 in 1932 or a Hank Greenberg 58 in 1938 or a Hack Wilson 56 in 1930 made the bid But now for the first time since Lou Gehrig with 47 home runs spurred Ruth on in 1927 two men playing for the same team have zeroed in on 60 Their names are Mantle and Maris their team is the Yankees and their threat is real After 108 games in 1927 Ruth had 35 home runs After 108 games in 1961 Mickey Mantle has 43 Roger Maris 41 Extend Mantle's and Maris's present paces over the full 1961 schedule of 162 games and mathematically each will hit more than 60 home runs This is the great edge the two Yankees have going for them To better Ruth's mark neither needs a spectacular September flourish All Mantle needs is eight more home runs in August and ten in September and he will establish a new record In Ruth's day and until this year the schedule was 154 games Baseball commissioner Ford Frick has ruled that Ruth's record will remain official unless it is broken in 154 games Even on the basis of 154 games this is the ideal situation insists Hank Greenberg now vice-president of the Chicago White Sox It has to be easier with two of them How can you walk Maris to get to Mantle Roommates Neither Mantle nor Maris understandably will predict 60 home runs for himself Although both concede they would like to hit 60 they stick primarily to the baseball player's standard quote The important thing is to win the pennant But one thing is for certain There is no dissension between Mantle the American League's Most Valuable Player in 1956 and 1957 and Maris the MVP in 1960 Each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs I hope Roger hits 80 Mantle says and each enjoys even more seeing himself hit home runs and I hope I hit 81 The sluggers get along so well in fact that with their families at home for the summer Mantle's in Dallas Maris's in Kansas City they are rooming together Mantle Maris and Bob Cerv a utility outfielder share an apartment in Jamaica Long Island not far from New York International Airport The three pay a month for four rooms kitchen dining room living room and bedroom with air-conditioning and new modern furniture Mantle and Cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom Maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living room They divide up the household chores Cerv does most of the cooking breakfast and sandwich snacks with dinner out Mantle supplies the transportation a white 1961 Oldsmobile convertible and Maris drives the 25-minute course from the apartment house to Yankee Stadium Mantle Maris and Cerv probably share one major-league record already Among them they have fifteen children eight for Cerv four for Mantle and three for Maris As roommates teammates and home-run mates Mantle 29 who broke in with the Yankees ten years ago and Maris 26 who came to the Yankees from Kansas City two years ago have strikingly similar backgrounds Both were scholastic stars in football basketball and baseball Mantle in Commerce Okla. Maris in Fargo N.D. as halfbacks both came close to playing football at the University of Oklahoma Sometimes in the minors Maris recalls I wished I had gone to Oklahoma To an extent the two even look alike Both have blue eyes and short blond hair Both are 6 feet tall and weigh between 195 and 200 pounds but Mantle incredibly muscular he has a 17-1/2-inch neck looks bigger With their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders both must have their clothes made to order Maris purchases suits from Simpson's in New York Mantle more concerned with dress buys his suits four at a time at Neiman-Marcus in Dallas and pays as much as each Light reading Neither Mantle nor Maris need fear being classified an intellectual but lately Mantle has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer Mantle so appreciated Miller's delicate literary style that he broadened teammates' minds by reading sensitive passages aloud during road trips Mantle is not normally given to public speaking or for that matter to private speaking What do you and Mickey talk about at home A reporter asked Maris recently To tell you the truth Maris said Mickey don't talk much This is no surprising trait for a ballplayer What is surprising and pleasant is that Mantle and Maris under constant pressure from writers and photographers are trying to be cooperative Of the two Mantle is by nature the less outgoing Maris the more outspoken But last week when a reporter was standing near Mantle's locker Mickey walked up and volunteered an anecdote See that kid He said pointing to a dark-haired 11-year-old boy That's Yogi Berra's I'll never forget one time I struck out three times dropped a fly ball and we lost the game I came back sitting by my locker feeling real low and the kid walks over to me looks up and says You stunk Maris in talking to reporters tries to answer all questions candidly and fully but on rare occasions he shuns newsmen When I've made a dumb play he says I don't want to talk to anyone I'm angry By his own confession Maris is an angry young man Benched at Tulsa in 1955 he told manager Dutch Meyer I can't play for you Send me where I can play Meyer sent him to Reading Pa. Benched at Indianapolis in 1956 he told manager Kerby Farrell I'm not learning anything on the bench Play me Farrell did and Maris led the team to victory in the Little World Series That's the way I am he says I tell people what I think If you're a good ballplayer you've got to get mad Give me a team of nine angry men and I'll give you a team of nine gentlemen and we'll beat you nine out of ten times Idols' idols One good indication of the two men's personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes Maris's was Ted Williams When I was a kid Maris told a sportswriter last week I used to follow Williams every day in the box score just to see whether he got a hit or not When you came up to the majors did you seek out Williams for advice Are you kidding Said Maris You're afraid to talk to a guy you idolize Mantle's hero was Joe DiMaggio When Mickey went to the Yankees says Mark Freeman an ex-Yankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in Denver DiMaggio still was playing and every day Mickey would go by his locker just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man this hero of his But DiMaggio never said a word It crushed Mickey He told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star this never would be said of him Mantle has kept the vow Among all the Yankees he is the veteran most friendly to rookies Neither Mantle nor Maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else If laying ties on a railroad track which he once did for an hour paid more than playing right field for the Yankees Maris would lay ties on a railroad track If working in a zinc mine which he once did for 87-1/2 cents an hour paid more than playing center field for the Yankees Mantle would work in a zinc mine But since railroading and mining are not the highest paid arts Mantle and Maris concentrate on baseball They try to play baseball the best they can Each is a complete ballplayer Mantle beyond any question can do more things well One of the reasons they get along fine says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men is that both realize Mantle is head-and-shoulders above Maris Hitting Mantle has an immediate advantage because he bats both left-handed and right-handed Maris only left-handed They both possess near classic stances dug in firmly arms high set for fierce swings Mantle is considerably better hitting for average fourth in the league to for Maris so far this year Both are good bunters Maris once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues Mantle is a master at dragging a bunt toward first base Both have brilliant speed Mantle was timed from home plate batting left-handed to first base in 3.1 seconds faster than any other major leaguer Maris ran the 100-yard dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a race against Luis Aparicio the swift base-stealing shortstop of the White Sox Both are good daring fielders Mantle covers more ground Maris's throwing arm is stronger Yet with all their skills the appeal of Mantle and Maris in 1961 comes down to one basic The home run With this ultimate weapon the two Yankees may have saved baseball from its dullest season American League expansion created inevitably weaker teams Only two teams in each league the Yankees and Detroit the Dodgers and Cincinnati are battling for first place Appropriately the emphasis on the home run at a peak this year came into being at baseball's lowest moment In 1920 as the startling news that the 1919 White Sox had conspired to lose the World Series leaked out fans grew disillusioned and disinterested in baseball Something was needed to revive interest the something was the home run Into Washington on President-elect John F.

David Thompson is one of those names known to the stewards of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in Europe's best hotels but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town of Pittsburgh There the name vaguely connotes new-rich wealth a reputation for eccentricity and an ardor for collecting art Last week in the German city of Dusseldorf G. David Thompson was making headlines that could well give Pittsburgh pause On display were 343 first-class paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection and every single one of them was up for sale Like Philadelphia's late Dr. Albert C. Barnes who kept his own great collection closed to the general public Time Jan. 2 Thompson at 61 is something of a legend in his own lifetime He made his fortune during World War 2 when he took over a number of dying steel plants and kept them alive until the boom Even before he hit big money he had begun buying modern paintings He gave the impression of never having read a word about art but there was no doubt that he had an eye for the best He was able to smell a bargain and a masterpiece a continent away and the Museum of Modern Art's Alfred Barr said of him I have never mentioned a new artist that Thompson didn't know about He might barge into a gallery start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting He could be lavishly generous with friends cab drivers and bellboys but with dealers he was tough He bought up Cezannes Braques Matisses Legers a splendid Picasso series more than 70 Giacometti sculptures He gathered one of the biggest collections of Paul Klees in the world All these he hung in his burglarproof home called Stone's Throw outside Pittsburgh and only people he liked and trusted ever got to see them Two years ago Thompson offered his collection to the city But he insisted that it be housed in a special museum Pittsburgh turned him down just as Pittsburgh society had been snubbing him for years He went then to a 40-year-old Basel art dealer named Ernst Beyeler with whom he had long been trading pictures Last year Beyeler arranged to sell worth of Klees to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia which will house them in a museum that is yet to be built Last week most of the other prizes once offered to Pittsburgh went on the block At the opening of the Dusseldorf show Thompson himself scarcely glanced at the treasures that he was seeing together for the last time In fact he seemed delighted to get rid of them Some observers speculated that this might be his revenge on his home town Thompson himself said I want to enjoy once more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new pictures Break in Georgia The University of Georgia has long claimed that it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race or color But in all its 175 years not a single Negro student has entered its classrooms Last week Federal District Judge William A. Bootle ordered the university to admit immediately a qualified Negro boy and girl Their entry will crack the total segregation of all public education from kindergarten through graduate school in Georgia and in Alabama Mississippi and South Carolina as well For 18 months Hamilton Holmes 19 and Charlayne Hunter 18 had tried to get into the university They graduated together from Atlanta's Turner High School where Valedictorian Holmes was first in the class and Charlayne third The university rejected them on a variety of pretexts but was careful never to mention the color of their skins Holmes went to Atlanta's Morehouse Negro College where he is a B student and star halfback Charlayne studied journalism at Detroit's Wayne State University Last fall after they took their hopes for entering Georgia to court Judge Bootle ordered them to apply again Charlayne was tentatively admitted for next fall after state investigators questioned her white roommate at Wayne State But Holmes was rejected again on the basis of his record and interview The evidence in court was testimony about the interview which for Holmes lasted an hour although at least one white student at Georgia got through this ritual by a simple phone conversation Holmes was asked if he had ever visited a house of prostitution or a beatnik parlor or teahouse No said he but officials still called him evasive They also said he lied in saying that he had never been arrested Their reason Holmes once paid a speeding fine had his license suspended Negro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white students found that many were hardly interviewed at all and few had academic records as good as Hamilton Holmes The real reason for his rejection they argued is the fact that Georgia law automatically cuts off funds for any desegregated school Judge Bootle's decision The two plaintiffs are qualified for admission to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been for their race and color The state will appeal but few think it will actually try to close the university Surprised and pleased Students Holmes and Hunter may enter the University of Georgia this week Catch for Chicago When the University of Chicago's Chancellor Lawrence A. Kimpton submitted his resignation last March a mighty talent hunt gripped the Midway Out went letters to 60,000 old grads asking for suggestions Such academic statesmen as James B. Conant were consulted Two committees pondered 375 possible Kimpton successors including Adlai Stevenson Richard Nixon and Harvard's Dean McGeorge Bundy The debate led to a decision that Chicago needed neither a big name nor an experienced academic administrator but rather as Trustee Chairman Glen A. Lloyd put it a top scholar in his own right a bright light to lure other top scholars to Chicago Last week Chicago happily found its top scholar in Caltech's acting dean of the faculty dynamic Geneticist George Wells Beadle 57 who shared the 1958 Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell chemistry Time Cover July 14 1958 It fell to Chancellor Kimpton now a Standard Oil Indiana executive to spend his nine-year reign tidying up Chicago after the 21-year typhoon of Idealist Robert Maynard Hutchins He threw out some of Hutchins' more wildly experimental courses raised sagging undergraduate enrollment to 2,100 nearly doubled endowment to million But though Kimpton put Chicago in what he felt was working order some old grads feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it in the heady Hutchins era At Caltech Geneticist Beadle has stuck close to his research as head of the school's famous biology division since 1946 But he has shown a sixth-sense ability to spot recruit and excite able researchers and has developed unexpected talents in fund raising and speech-making Beadle is even that rare scientist who takes an interest in money matters he avidly reads the Wall Street Journal and took delight in driving a model A Ford for 22 years then selling it for A philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end But a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away The man was King Leopold 2 of the Belgians who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good By force he took under his protection or stole 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa This is an area nearly as large as Western Europe and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity Its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings they were determined by the points at which Leopold's explorers and gunmen got tired of walking The population of the Congo is 13.5 million divided into at least seven major culture clusters and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects The religions of the people include Christianity Mohammedanism paganism ancestor worship and animism The climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate The hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars To make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any case it has been made far more difficult by what the Belgians have done or failed to do in the Congo since 1885 At first the Belgian royal family administered the Congo as its own private property But by 1908 its record of brutality had touched the national conscience The Belgian government itself took over administration commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism One definition of paternalism is The principle or practice on the part of a government of managing the affairs of a country in the manner of a father dealing with his children The honor of the Belgians in this matter is not to be questioned only their judgment Ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time but when the colony received independence in 1960 the Congolese child if one imagines him to have been born in 1908 was 52 and had until then been treated as an infant The Belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the Congo which is rich in copper tin cobalt manganese zinc and uranium and cotton and palm oil The colony was administered from Brussels with neither the Congolese nor the resident Belgians having any vote The beneficiaries of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both individuals and the Belgian government itself held stock In Inside Africa John Gunther describes one of these the Societe Generale as the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if let us say the House of Morgan Anaconda Copper the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York the Pennsylvania Railroad and various companies producing agricultural products were lumped together with the United States government as a heavy partner Had they been truly ruthless the Belgians might have exploited the Congolese without compassion But they were not They provided a social security system which covered all their African employes their program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent they put much effort into public housing They also instituted a ration system under which all employers in the Congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food But instead of delivering the ration either in actual commodities or in cash at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month the Belgians felt obliged to dole it out more often Would not the children if they received all their food on the first day of the month eat it up immediately and later go hungry The Belgians also placed great emphasis on education During the 1950s there were as many as 25,000 schools in the Congo But almost all the schools were primary The average Congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of la chatte and le chien and write his name Some schools were technical the Belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land and trained many But they did not believe in widespread secondary education much less in college It was their conviction that the people should be brought up together a grade at a time until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history economics and political science Indeed the Belgians discouraged higher education fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest When the Congo received its independence in 1960 there were among its 13.5 million people exactly 14 university graduates Why did the Belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it In one large oversimplification it might be said that the Belgians felt far too late the gale of nationalism sweeping Africa They lacked time to prepare the Congo as the British and French had prepared their colonies The Congolese were clamoring for their independence even though most were unsure what it meant and in Brussels street crowds shouted Pas une goutte de sang Not one drop of blood The Belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue rather than teach where teaching was not wanted they would wash their hands of the mess It is hard to blame them for this Yet there were other motivations and actions which the Belgians took after independence for which history may not find them guiltless As the time for independence approached there were in the Congo no fewer than 120 political parties or approximately eight for each university graduate There were four principal ones First there were those Congolese among them Joseph Kasavubu who favored splitting the country into small independent states Balkanizing it Second there were those Moise Tshombe who favored near-Balkanization a loose federalism having a central government of limited authority with much power residing in the states Third there were those notably Patrice Lumumba who favored a unified Congo with a very strong central government And fourth there were moderates who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the Congo grew up However the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting A final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation of the Congo immediately after independence was the provincial structure that had been established by the Belgians for convenience in administration They had divided the Congo into six provinces Leopoldville Kasai Kivu Katanga Equator and Eastern unfortunately with little regard for ethnic groupings Thus some provinces contained tribes which detested each other and to them independence meant an opportunity for war The Belgian Congo was granted its independence with what seemed a workable Western-style form of government there were to be a president and a premier and a bicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provinces Well-wishers around the world hoped that the Congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations If internal frictions arose they could be handled by the 25,000-man Congolese army the Force Publique which had been trained and was still officered by white Belgians The president Joseph Kasavubu seemed an able administrator and the premier Patrice Lumumba a reasonable man Twenty-four hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting each other Presently the well-armed members of the Force Publique many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes erupted in mutiny rioting raping and looting Terror engulfed the thousands of Belgian civilians who had remained in the country The Belgian government decided to act and on July 10 dispatched paratroops to the Congo On July 11 the head of the mineral-rich province of Katanga Moise Tshombe announced that his province had seceded from the country Confusion became chaos each succeeding day brought new acts of violence Lumumba and Kasavubu blamed it all on the military intervention by the Belgians and appealed to the United Nations to send troops to oust them On July 14 the Security Council with France and Great Britain abstaining voted the resolution which drew the U.N. into the Congo Vague in wording it called for withdrawal of Belgian troops and authorized the Secretary-General to take the necessary steps to provide the Congolese Government with such military assistance as may be necessary until through the efforts of the Congolese Government with the technical assistance of the United Nations the national security forces may be able in the opinion of the Government to meet fully their tasks Secretary-General Hammarskjold decided that it would be preferable if the U.N. troops sent into the Congo were to come from African or at least nonwhite nations certainly not from the U.S. Russia Great Britain or France He quickly called on Ghana Tunisia Morocco Guinea and Mali which dispatched troops within hours Ultimately the U.N. army in the Congo reached a top strength of 19,000 including about 5,000 from India and a few soldiers from Eire and Sweden who were the only whites It took the U.N. three months to bring a modest form of order to the Congo The Belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed U.N. efforts The wildly erratic nature of Patrice Lumumba caused constant problems he frequently announced that he wanted the U.N. to get out of the Congo along with the Belgians and appealed to Russia for help However there is little evidence that the late Lumumba was a Communist Before appealing to the U.N. or to Russia he first appealed to the U.S. for military help and was rejected Lumumba further complicated the U.N.'s mission by initiating small wars with the secessionist province of Katanga and with South Kasai which under Albert Kalonji wanted to secede as well Meanwhile Russia took every opportunity to meddle in the Congo sending Lumumba equipment for his wars dispatching technicians and even threatening on occasion to intervene openly But by the end of the three-month period in October 1960 something approaching calm settled on the Congo President Kasavubu became exasperated with Lumumba and fired him Lumumba fired Kasavubu Control of the government such control as there was and such government as there was passed into the hands of Joseph Mobutu chief of staff of the Congolese army Mobutu promptly flung out the Russians who have not since played any significant part on the local scene although they have redoubled their obstructionist efforts at U.N. headquarters in New York The Belgians at least officially departed from the Congo as well withdrawing all of their uniformed troops But they left behind them large numbers of officers variously called volunteers or mercenaries who now staff the army of Moise Tshombe in Katanga the seceded province which according to Tshombe holds 65% of the mineral wealth of the entire country From October 1960 to February 1961 the U.N. forces in the Congo took little action There was no directive for it the Security Council's resolution had not mentioned political matters and in any case the United Nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political affairs of any nation whether to unify it federalize it or Balkanize it During the five-month lull civil war smoldered and flickered throughout the Congo In February the murder of Patrice Lumumba who had been kidnaped into Katanga and executed on order of Tshombe again stirred the U.N. to action On Feb. 21 the council passed another resolution urging the taking of all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the Congo including the use of force if necessary in the last resort Although the resolution might have been far more specific it was considerably tougher than the earlier one It also urged that the U.N. eject and prevent the return of all Belgian and other foreign military and political advisers ordered an investigation of Lumumba's death urged the reconvention of the Congolese Parliament and the reorganization of the army The presidency talking and listening Though President John F. Kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of Berlin and disarmament adviser McCloy's unexpected report from Khrushchev his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of U.S. foreign policy last week High up on the President's priority list was the thorny question of Bizerte On this issue the President received a detailed report from his U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson who had just returned from Paris and Mr. Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving way for both Paris and Tunis out of the imbroglio Ideally the President would like the French to agree on a status quo ante on Bizerte and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean base To continue their important conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems Mr. Kennedy invited Stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekend The President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with the No. 2 man in the Tunisian Government Defense Minister Bahi Ladgham who flew to Washington last week to seek U.S. support The conversation apparently convinced Mr. Kennedy that the positions of France and Tunisia were not irreconcilable Through Ladgham Mr. Kennedy sent a message along those lines to Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba and one U.S. official said The key question now is which side picks up the phone first On the Latin American front the President held talks with Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon before sending him to Uruguay and the Inter-American Economic and Social Council which the President himself had originally hoped to attend Main purpose of the meeting To discuss President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress And that was not all In conferences with Nationalist China's dapper diminutive Vice President Chen Cheng Mr. Kennedy assured Chiang Kai-shek's emissary that the U.S. is as firmly opposed as ever to the admission of Red China to the United Nations Chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission of Outer Mongolia however the President who would like to woo the former Chinese province away from both Peking and Moscow would promise Chen nothing more than an abstention by the U.S. if Outer Mongolia's admission comes to a vote The President also conferred with emissaries from Guatemala and Nepal who are seeking more foreign aid To Africa he sent his most trusted adviser his brother Attorney General Robert Kennedy on a good-will mission to the Ivory Coast All week long the President clearly was playing a larger personal role in foreign affairs in effect he was practicing what he preached in his Berlin message two weeks ago when he declared We shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk and listen with reason Crime skyjacked From International Airport in Los Angeles to International Airport in Houston as the great four-jet Boeing 707 flies is a routine five hours and 25 minutes including stopovers at Phoenix El Paso and San Antonio When Continental Airlines night-coach Flight 54 took off at 11:30 one night last week there was no reason to think it would take any longer The plane put down on schedule at 1:35 a.m. in Phoenix Thirty-one minutes later when it took off for El Paso hardly anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers paid any attention to the man and teen-age boy who had come aboard At 3:57 a.m. with the plane about twenty minutes out of El Paso passenger Robert Berry a San Antonio advertising man glanced up and saw the man and boy accompanied by a stewardess walking up the aisle toward the cockpit The man was bent over with his hand on his stomach Berry said I figured he was sick John Salvador a farmer from Palm Desert Calif. was sitting up front and could see through the door as the trio entered the cockpit The kid had a automatic like they issue in the Army he said The other fellow had a Salvador saw the youth hold his against the head of stewardess Lois Carnegey the man put his at the head of Capt. Byron D. Rickards To Rickards a 52-year-old veteran 30 years in the air it was an old story His plane was being hijacked in mid-flight again much as it had happened in 1930 when Peruvian rebels made him land a Ford tri-motor at Arequipa But last week's pirates like the Cuban-American who recently hijacked an Eastern Airlines Electra Newsweek Aug. 7 wanted to go to Havana Stalling Tell your company there are four of us here with guns the elder man told Rickards The pilot radioed El Paso International Airport with just that message But he told the skyjackers the 707 didn't carry enough fuel to reach Havana they would have to refuel at El Paso Most passengers didn't know what had happened until they got on the ground Jerry McCauley of Sacramento Calif. one of some twenty Air Force recruits on board awoke from a nap in confusion The old man came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers to go to Cuba McCauley said and like a nut I raised my hand I thought he was the Air Force recruiter What the man wanted was four persons to volunteer as hostages along with the crew They chose four Jack Casey who works for Continental Airlines in Houston Fred Mullen from Mercer Island Wash. Pfc. Truman Cleveland of St. Augustine Fla. and Leonard Gilman a former college boxer and veteran of the U.S. Immigration Service Border Patrol Everybody else was allowed to file off the plane after it touched down at El Paso at 4:18 a.m. They found a large welcoming group El Paso policemen Border Patrol sheriff's deputies and FBI men who surged around the plane with rifles and submachine guns Other FBI men talking with the pilot from the tower conspired with him to delay the proposed flight to Havana The ground crew which ordinarily fuels a 707 in twenty minutes took fully three hours Still more time was consumed while the pilot at the radioed suggestion of Continental president Robert Six tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the Boeing jet for a propeller-driven Douglas Aj Actually the officers on the ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get away with any kind of an airplane they had orders to that effect straight from President Kennedy who thought at first as did most others that it was four followers of Cuba's Fidel Castro who had taken over the 707 Mr. Kennedy had been informed early in the day of the attempt to steal the plane kept in touch throughout by telephone At one time while still under the impression that he was dealing with a Cuban plot the President talked about invoking a total embargo on trade with Cuba As the morning wore on and a blazing West Texas sun wiped the shadows off the Franklin Mountains police got close enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment From the luggage they learned that the two air pirates far from being Cubans were native Americans subsequently identified as Leon Bearden 50-year-old ex-convict from Coolidge Ariz. and his son Cody 16 a high-school junior Tension The heat and strain began to tell on the Beardens The father by accident or perhaps to show as he said we mean business took the and fired a slug between the legs of Second Officer Norman Simmons At 7:30 a.m. more than three hours after landing the Beardens gave an ultimatum Take off or see the hostages killed The tower cleared the plane for take-off at 8 a.m. and Captain Rickards began taxiing toward the runway Several police cars loaded with armed officers raced alongside blazing away at the tires of the big jet The slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard engines the plane slowed to a halt Ambulances baggage trucks and cars surrounded it The day wore on At 12:50 p.m. a ramp was rolled up to the plane A few minutes later FBI agent Francis Crosby talking fast eased up the ramp to the plane unarmed While Crosby distracted the Beardens stewardesses Carnegey and Toni Besset dropped out of a rear door So did hostages Casey Cleveland and Mullen That left only the four crew members Crosby and Border Patrolman Gilman all unarmed with the Beardens The elder Bearden had one pistol in his hand the other in a hip pocket Gilman started talking to him until he saw his chance He caught officer Simmons' eye nodded toward young Bearden and I swung my right as hard as I could Simmons and Crosby jumped the boy and it was all over Frog-marched off the airplane at 1:48 p.m. the Beardens were held in bail of each on charges of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across state lines Bearden reportedly hoped to peddle the plane to Castro and live high in Cuba Back home in Coolidge Ariz. his 36-year-old wife Mary said I thought they were going to Phoenix to look for jobs Congress more muscle Taking precedence over all other legislation on Capitol Hill last week was the military strength of the nation The Senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed speed and unanimity to pass 85 to 0 the largest peacetime defense budget in U.S. history With the money all but in hand however the Administration indicated that instead of the 225,000 more men in uniform that President Kennedy had requested the armed forces would be increased by only 160,000 The hold-back as Pentagon mutterers labeled it apparently was a temporary expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually and thus the new funds spent prudently In all the Senate signed a check for billion which not only included the extra billion requested the week before by President Kennedy but tacked on million more than the President had asked for The Senate on its own decided to provide additional B-52 and other long-range bombers for the Strategic Air Command The House which had passed its smaller appropriation before the President's urgent call for more was expected to go along with the increased defense budget in short order In other areas Congressional action last week included The Senate by voice vote and the House by 224-170 passed and sent to the White House the compromise farm bill which the President is expected to sign not too unhappily The Senate also voted billion to finance the government's health welfare and labor activities Debate on the all-important foreign-aid bill with its controversial long-range proposals had just begun on the Senate floor at the weekend White House legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact Food stew a la Mulligatawny Most members of the U.S. Senate because they are human like to eat as high on the hog as they can But because they are politicians they like to talk as poor-mouth as the lowliest voter As a result ever since 1851 when the Senate restaurant opened in the new wing of the Capitol Building the senators have never ceased to grumble about the food even while they opposed every move that might improve it Over the years enlivened chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of Maine and Idaho potatoes the menu has pursued its drab all-American course Individual senators with an eye to the voters back home occasionally introduced smelts from Michigan soft-shell crabs from Maryland oysters from Washington grapefruit from Florida But plain old bean soup served daily since the turn of the century at the insistence of the late Sen. Fred Dubois of Idaho made clear to the citizenry that the Senate's stomach was in the right place In a daring stroke the Senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute cuisine and hired a French-born maitre d'hotel Holders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes Long-term trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward Higher toll rates also are helping boost revenues Result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative Things are looking up these days for many of the State turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road bonds Traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing That added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates As a result of the new outlook for turnpikes investors who bought toll-road bonds when these securities ranked as outright speculations are now finding new hope for their investments Another result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these tax-exempt bonds Other tax-exempt bonds of State and local governments hit a price peak on February 21 according to Standard Poor's average On balance prices of those bonds have slipped a bit since then However in the same three-month period toll-road bonds as a group have bucked this trend On these bonds price rises since February 21 easily outnumber price declines Tax-free returns Investors however still see an element of more-than-ordinary risk in the toll-road bonds You find the evidence of that in the chart on this page Many of the toll-road bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent or very close to that And this is true in the case of some turnpikes on which revenues have risen close to or beyond the point at which the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on the bonds That 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bonds It's not much more in fact than the return that is offered on U. S. Treasury bonds For investors whose income is taxed at high rates though a tax-free yield of 4 per cent is high It is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried investor with more than of income to be taxed or for a married couple with more than of taxed income Swelling traffic A new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the most recent 12-month period ending in February or March shows what is happening The report is based on a survey by Blyth Company investment bankers Nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the period And there is the bright note The gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession Many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter Indication The long-term trend of turnpike traffic is upward Look for example at the Ohio Turnpike Traffic on that road slumped sharply in January and February as compared with those same months in 1960 Then March brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues after operating costs As a result the road's net revenues in the 12 months ending March 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bonds That was up from 173 per cent in the preceding 12 months That same pattern of earnings shows up on the Massachusetts Turnpike Operating revenues were off in the first three months of 1961 but up for the 12 months ending in March Costs were held down despite a bitter winter For the year the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs against 121 per cent in the preceding period The road's engineers look for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into Boston Slow successes Some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can do The 187-mile Illinois State Toll Highway for example was not opened over its entire length until December 1958 In the 12 months ended in February 1960 the highway earned enough to cover 64 per cent of its interest load with the remainder paid out of initial reserves In the 12 months ended in February 1961 this highway earned 93 per cent of its interest That improvement is continuing In the first two months of 1961 earnings of the Illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent from early 1960 Success for many turnpikes has come hard Traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers' rosy estimates In these cases the turnpike managements have had to turn to toll-rate increases or to costly improvements such as extensions or better connections with other highways Many rate increases already have been put into effect Higher tolls are planned for July 1 1961 on the Richmond-Petersburg Va. Turnpike and proposals for increased tolls on the Texas Turnpike are under study Easier access Progress is being made too in improving motorists' access to many turnpikes The Kansas Turnpike offers an illustration Net earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended Feb. 28 1961 Further improvements in earnings of the Kansas Turnpike are expected late in 1961 with the opening of a new bypass at Wichita and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in both Kansas City Kans. and Kansas City Mo. Meanwhile there appears to be enough money in the road's reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years For some roads troubles Investors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals Traffic and revenues on the Chicago Skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike If nothing is done the prospect is that that road will be in default of interest in 1962 West Virginia toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months and despite recent improvement in revenues holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same These however are exceptions The typical picture at this time is one of steady improvement It's going to take time for investors to learn how many of the toll-road bonds will pay out in full Already however several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins Many others are attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the break-even point A top American official after a look at Europe's factories thinks the U.S. is in a very serious situation competitively Commerce Secretary Luther Hodges accompanied by a member of our staff on May 10 toured plants of two of Italy's biggest companies Fiat the auto producer and Olivetti maker of typewriters and calculating machines Our staff man cabled from Turin as follows Follow Secretary Hodges through the Fiat plant and you learn this One modern equipment much of it supplied under the Marshall Plan enables Fiat to turn out 2,100 cars a day About half of these are exported Two wage costs are a fraction of the U.S. costs A skilled worker on the assembly line for example earns a week Three labor troubles are infrequent Fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more than six years Said Secretary Hodges It's a tough combination for the U.S. to face Olivetti had a special interest for Hodges Olivetti took over Underwood the U.S. typewriter maker in late 1959 Within a year without reducing wages Underwood's production costs were cut one third prices were slashed The result has been that exports of Underwood products have doubled The Olivetti plant near Turin has modern layout modern machinery The firm is design-conscious sales-conscious advertising-conscious Hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the U.S. The inflow of foreign capital would help the U.S. balance of payments Hodges predicted I think we will see more foreign firms coming to the U.S. There are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas Foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that Washington is exploring new ways of handling competitive imports The recently unveiled Kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for American businessmen in many lines Important aspects of the Kennedy textile plans are these An international conference of the big textile-importing and textile-exporting countries will be called shortly by President Kennedy Chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting The U.S. will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the less-developed countries over the years Point is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first need encouragement to get on their feet If they have trouble exporting international bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would Idea is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible At the same time another purpose of the conference will be to get certain low-wage countries to control textile exports especially dumping of specific products to high-wage textile-producing countries Japan since 1957 has been voluntarily curbing exports of textiles to the U.S. Hong Kong India and Pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to Britain for several years under the Lancashire Pact None of these countries is happy with these arrangements The Japanese want to increase exports to the U.S. While they have been curbing shipments they have watched Hong Kong step in and capture an expanding share of the big U.S. market Hong Kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to Britain while Spanish and Portuguese textiles pour into British market unrestrictedly The Indians and Pakistanis are chafing under similar restrictions on the British market for similar reasons The Kennedy hope is that at the conference or through bilateral talks the low-wage textile-producing countries in Asia and Europe will see that dumping practices cause friction all around and may result in import quotas Gradual controlled expansion of the world's textile trade is what President Kennedy wants This may point the way toward international stabilization agreements in other products It's an important clue to Washington thinking Note too that the Kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the U.S. textile industry Get competitive or get out In veiled terms that's what the Kennedy Administration is saying to the American textile industry The Government will help in transferring companies and workers into new lines where modernization doesn't seem feasible Special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allowed Government research will look into new products and methods Import quotas aren't ruled out where the national interest is involved But the Kennedy Administration doesn't favor import quotas Rather they are impressed with the British Government's success in forcing and helping the British textile industry to shrink and to change over to other products What's happening in textiles can be handwriting on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with imports from low-wage countries Among the highest-paid workers in the world are U.S. coal miners Yet U.S. coal is cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers' mouths water Steel Company of Wales a British steelmaker wants to bring in Virginia coal cut down on its takings of Welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively especially in foreign markets Virginia coal delivered by ship in Wales will be about a ton cheaper than Welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines U.S. coal is cheap despite high wages because of widespread mechanization of mines wide coal seams attactive rates on ocean freight Many of the coal seams in the nationalized British mines are twisting narrow and very deep Productivity of U.S. miners is twice that of the British Welsh coal miners Communist-led are up in arms at the suggestion that the steel company bring in American coal They threaten to strike The British Government will have to decide whether to let U.S. coal in The British coal industry is unprofitable has large coal stocks it can't sell Every library borrower or at least those whose taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically I'm sorry but we don't have that book There wouldn't be much demand for it I'm afraid Behind this reply and its many variations is the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face from the largest to the smallest What to buy out of the year's grist of nearly 15,000 book titles What to buy for adult and child readers for lovers of fiction and nonfiction for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified when your budget is pitifully small Most library budgets are hopelessly inadequate A startlingly high percentage do not exceed annually which includes the librarian's salary and not even the New York Public has enough money to meet its needs this in the world's richest city The plight of a small community library is proportionately worse Confronted with this situation most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have or else depend on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement their annual funds In some parts of the country however a co-operative movement has begun to grow under the wing of state governments whereby with the financial help of the state libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional basis New York State has what is probably the most advanced of these co-operative systems so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow Because it is so large a state with marked contrasts in population density the organization of the New York co-operative offers a cross-section of how the plan works At one extreme are the systems of upper New York State where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large sparsely populated area At the other are organizations like the newly formed Nassau Library System in a high-density area with ample resources and a rapidly growing territory to serve Both these types and those in between are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that began at Albany as early as 1950 with the creation by the legislature of county library systems financed by county governments with matching funds from the state It was a step in the right direction but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully the thriving systems of today Under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts An earlier difficulty was overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not as they saw fit Some library boards are wary of the plan A large well-stocked library surrounded in a county by smaller ones may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too great A small library may cherish its independence and established ways and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems radical to older members of the board Within a system however the autonomy of each member library is preserved The local community maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library program facilities and services but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a system All services are given without cost to members So obvious are these advantages that nearly 95 per cent of the population of New York State now has access to a system and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day not too distant when all the libraries in the state will belong to a co-op To set up a co-operative library system the law requires a central book collection of 100,000 nonfiction volumes as the nucleus and the system is organized around it The collection may be in an existing library or it may be built up in a central collection Each system develops differently according to the area it serves but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency The basic state grant is thirty cents for each person served and there is a further book incentive grant that provides an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita if a library spends a certain number of dollars In Nassau County for example the heavily settled Long Island suburb of New York City the system is credited by the state with serving one million persons a figure that has doubled since 1950 This system by virtue of its variety and size offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation The Nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference service what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area The need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries adequate to satisfy everyday needs could afford Nassau is currently building a central collection of reference materials in its Hempstead headquarters which will reach its goal of 100,000 volumes by 1965 The major part of this collection is in the central headquarters building and the remainder is divided among five libraries in the system designated as subject centers Basic reference tools are the backbone of the collection but there is also specialization in science and technology an indicated weakness in local libraries On microfilm headquarters also has a file of the New York Times from its founding in 1851 to the present day as well as bound volumes of important periodicals The entire headquarters collection is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans Headquarters gets about 100 requests every day It is connected by teletype with the State Library in Albany which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provide The books are carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other libraries Each subject center library was chosen because of its demonstrated strength in a particular area which headquarters could then build upon East Meadow has philosophy psychology and religion Freeport houses social science pure science and language history biography and education are centered in Hempstead Levittown has applied science business and literature while Hewlett-Woodmere is the repository of art music and foreign languages The reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen local reference service This kind of cooperation is not wholly new of course Public libraries in Nassau County have been lending books to each other by mail for a quarter-century but the system enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basis Local libraries find too that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library The system passes on these savings to its members Further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping and clerical detail as the result of central billing Books are not the only resource of the system Schools and community groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary art and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs and to organizations in member communities The most recent film catalogue available at each library lists 110 titles presently in the collection any of which may be borrowed without charge This catalogue lists separately films suitable for children young adults or adults although some classics cut across age groups such as Nanook Of The North The Emperor's Nightingale and The Red Balloon Workshops are conducted by the system's audio-visual consultant for the staffs of member libraries teaching them the effective use of film as a library service The system well understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together consequently an experienced children's librarian at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote well-planned library activities cooperating with the children's librarians in member libraries by means of individual conferences workshops and frequent visits Headquarters has also set up a central juvenile book-review and book-selection center to provide better methods of purchasing and selection Sample copies of new books are on display at headquarters where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in workshop groups Story hours pre-school programs activities with community agencies and lists of recommended reading are all in the province of the children's consultant Headquarters of the Nassau system is an increasingly busy place these days threatening to expand beyond its boundaries In addition to the interlibrary loan service and the children's program headquarters has a public relations director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library service in the county it prepares cooperative displays posters booklists brochures and other promotional material for use in member libraries it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays already created and used and it publishes Sum And Substance a monthly newsletter which reports the system's activities to the staffs and trustees of member libraries The system itself is governed by a board of trustees geographically representing its membership In Nassau as in other systems the long-range objective is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools and on adult education in general Librarians a patient breed of men and women who have borne much with dedication can begin to see results today Library use is multiplying daily and the bulk of the newcomers are those maligned Americans the teen-agers To them especially the librarians with the help of co-ops hope they will never have to say I'm sorry we don't have that book Today more than ever before the survival of our free society depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned The great advances made in recent years in Communist strength and in our own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the Western world The need for lifetime reading is apparent Education must not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our entire lives for it is only through knowledge that we as a nation can cope with the dangers that threaten our society The desire and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life We cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read if we are not discriminating in our reading if we do not know how to use what we do read We must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific age as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed from the written word A fundamental source of knowledge in the world today is the book found in our libraries Although progress has been made in America's system of libraries it still falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that are needed for an informed America The problem grows in intensity each year as man's knowledge and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the written word continue to expand The inadequacy of our library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct this condition There are for example approximately 25,000,000 people in this country with no public library service and about 50,000,000 with inadequate service In college libraries 57 per cent of the total number of books are owned by 124 of 1,509 institutions surveyed last year by the U.S. Office of Education And over 66 per cent of the elementary schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any library at all In every aspect of service to the public to children in schools to colleges and universities the library of today is failing to render vitally needed services Only public understanding and support can provide that service This is one of the main reasons for National Library Week April 16-22 and for its theme For a richer fuller life read Assembly session brought much good The General Assembly which adjourns today has performed in an atmosphere of crisis and struggle from the day it convened It was faced immediately with a showdown on the schools an issue which was met squarely in conjunction with the governor with a decision not to risk abandoning public education There followed the historic appropriations and budget fight in which the General Assembly decided to tackle executive powers The final decision went to the executive but a way has been opened for strengthening budgeting procedures and to provide legislators information they need Long-range planning of programs and ways to finance them have become musts if the state in the next few years is to avoid crisis-to-crisis government This session for instance may have insured a financial crisis two years from now In all the turmoil some good legislation was passed Some other good bills were lost in the shuffle and await future action Certainly all can applaud passage of an auto title law the school bills the increase in teacher pensions the ban on drag racing acceptance by the state of responsibility for maintenance of state roads in municipalities at the same rate as outside city limits repeal of the college age limit law and the road maintenance bond issue No action has been taken however on such major problems as ending the fee system penal reform modification of the county unit system and in outright banning of fireworks sales Only a token start was made in attacking the tax reappraisal question and its companion issue of attracting industry to the state The legislature expended most of its time on the schools and appropriations questions Fortunately it spared us from the usual spate of silly resolutions which in the past have made Georgia look like anything but the empire state of the South We congratulate the entire membership on its record of good legislation In the interim between now and next year we trust the House and Senate will put their minds to studying Georgia's very real economic fiscal and social problems and come up with answers without all the political heroics League regularly stands on the side of right The League of Women Voters 40 now and admitting it proudly is inviting financial contributions in the windup of its fund drive It's a good use of money These women whose organization grew out of the old suffrage movement are dedicated to Thomas Jefferson's dictum that one must cherish the people's spirit but Keep alive their attention If once they become inattentive to the public affairs Jefferson said you and I and Congress and assemblies judges and governors shall all become wolves Newspapermen and politicians especially are aware of the penetrating attention and expert analysis the league gives to public affairs The league workers search out the pros and cons of the most complex issues and make them available to the public The harder the choice the more willing the league is to wade in And the league takes a stand with great regularity on the side of right Look to Coosa Valley for industrial progress Cities and counties interested in industrial development would do well in the months ahead to keep their eyes peeled toward the 13 northwest Georgia counties that are members of the Coosa Valley Area Planning and Development Commission Coupling its own budget of with a state grant authorized by Gov. Vandiver the group expects to sign a contract in March with Georgia Tech. Then a full-time planning office will be established in Rome to work with a five-member Georgia Tech research staff for development of an area planning and industrial development program The undertaking has abundant promise It recognizes the fact that what helps one county helps its neighbors and that by banding together in an area-wide effort better results can be accomplished than through the go-it-alone approach Rusk idea strengthens United States defense The Rusk belief in balanced defense replacing the Dulles theory of massive retaliation removes a grave danger that has existed The danger lay not in believing that our own A-bombs would deter Russia's use of hers that theory was and is sound The danger lay in the American delusion that nuclear deterrence was enough By limiting American strength too much to nuclear strength this country limited its ability to fight any kind of war besides a nuclear war This strategy heightened the possibility that we would have a nuclear war It also weakened our diplomatic stance because Russia could easily guess we did not desire a nuclear war except in the ultimate extremity This left the Soviets plenty of leeway to start low-grade brushfire aggressions with considerable impunity By maintaining the nuclear deterrent but gearing American military forces to fight conventional wars too Secretary of State Rusk junks bluff and nuclear brinkmanship and builds more muscle and greater safety into our military position DeKalb budget shows county is on beam DeKalb's budget for 1961 is a record one and carries with it the promise of no tax increase to make it balance It includes a raise in the county minimum wage creation of several new jobs at the executive level financing of beefed-up industrial development efforts and increased expenditures for essential services such as health and welfare fire protection sanitation and road maintenance That such expansion can be obtained without a raise in taxes is due to growth of the tax digest and sound fiscal planning on the part of the board of commissioners headed by Chairman Charles O. Emmerich who is demonstrating that the public trust he was given was well placed and other county officials Somewhere somebody is bound to love us G. Mennen Williams is learning the difficulties of diplomacy rapidly Touring Africa the new U.S. Assistant Secretary of State observed Africa should be for the Africans and the British promptly denounced him Then he arrived in Zanzibar and found Africans carrying signs saying American imperialists go home Chin up Soapy Power company backs confidence with dollars Confidence in the state's economic future is reflected in the Georgia Power Company's record construction budget for this year The firm does a large amount of research and its forecasts have meaning It is good to know that Georgia will continue to have sufficient electrical power not only to meet the demands of normal growth but to encourage a more rapid rate of industrialization Georgia's mental health program received a badly needed boost from the General Assembly in the form of a budget increase for the Milledgeville State Hospital Actually it amounts to above what the institution already is receiving considering the additional half-million dollars Gov. Vandiver allocated last year from the state surplus Either way it sounds like a sizable hunk of money and is But exactly how far it will go toward improving conditions is another question because there is so much that needs doing The practice of charging employes for meals whether they eat at the hospital or not should be abolished The work week of attendants who are on duty 65 hours and more per week should be reduced More attendants nurses and doctors should be hired Patients deserve more attention than they are getting Even with the increase in funds for the next fiscal year Georgia will be spending only around per day per patient The national average is more than and that figure is considered by experts in the mental health field to be too low Kansas regarded as tops in the nation in its treatment of the mentally ill spends per day per patient Georgia has made some reforms true The intensive treatment program is working well But in so many other areas we still are dragging Considering what is being done compared to what needs to be done it behooves the hospital management to do some mighty careful planning toward making the best possible use of the increase granted The boost is helpful but inadequate The end of Trujillo Assassination even of a tyrant is repulsive to men of good conscience Rafael Trujillo the often blood-thirsty dictator of the Dominican Republic for 31 years perhaps deserved his fate in an even-handed appraisal of history But whether the murder of El Benefactor in Ciudad Trujillo means freedom for the people of the Caribbean fiefdom is a question that cannot now be answered Trujillo knew a great deal about assassination The responsibility for scores of deaths including the abduction and murder of Jesus Maria Galindez a professor at Columbia University in New York has been laid at his door He had been involved in countless schemes to do away with democratic leaders in neighboring countries such as President Romulo Betancourt of Venezuela It was a sort of poetic justice that at the time of his own demise a new plot to overthrow the Venezuelan government reportedly involving the use of Dominican arms by former Venezuelan Dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez has been uncovered and quashed The recent history of the Dominican Republic is an almost classical study of the way in which even a professedly benevolent dictatorship tends to become oppressive Unquestionably Trujillo did some good things for his country he improved public facilities such as roads and sanitation attracted industry and investment and raised the standard of living notably But the price was the silence of the grave for all criticism or opposition El Benefactor's vanity grew with his personal wealth The jails were filled to overflowing with political prisoners who had incurred his displeasure He maintained amply financed lobbies in the United States and elsewhere which sycophantically chanted his praise and his influence extended even to Congress Until the last year or so the profession of friendship with the United States had been an article of faith with Trujillo and altogether too often this profession was accepted here as evidence of his good character Tardily the Government here came to understand how this country's own reputation was tarnished by the association with repression Last year after Trujillo had been cited for numerous aggressions in the Caribbean the United States and many other members of the Organization of American States broke diplomatic relations with him Thereupon followed a demonstration that tyranny knows no ideological confines Trujillo's dictatorship had been along conservative right-wing lines But after the censure he and his propaganda started mouthing Communist slogans There was considerable evidence of a tacit rapprochement with Castro in Cuba previously a bete noire to Trujillo thus illustrating the way in which totalitarianism of the right and left coalesces What comes after Trujillo is now the puzzle The Dominican people have known no democratic institutions and precious little freedom for a generation and all alternative leadership has been suppressed Perhaps the army will be able to maintain stability but the vacuum of free institutions creates a great danger The Dominican Republic could turn toward Communist-type authoritarianism as easily as toward Western freedom Such a twist would be a tragedy for the Dominican people who deserve to breathe without fear For that reason any democratic reform and effort to bring genuine representative government to the Dominican Republic will need the greatest sympathy and help Start on rapid transit High-speed buses on the George Washington Memorial Parkway operating between downtown Washington and Cabin John Glen Echo and Brookmont would constitute an alluring sample of what the new National Capital Transportation Agency can do for this city In presenting plans for such express buses before the Montgomery County Council the administrator of the NCTA C. Darwin Stolzenbach was frankly seeking support for the projects his agency will soon be launching Such support should not be difficult to come by if all the plans to be presented by the NCTA are as attractive as this outline of express buses coming into the downtown area Because the buses would not stop on the parkway land for bus stations and for parking areas nearby will be needed The NCTA is well advised to seek funds for this purpose from the present session of Congress Must Berlin remain divided The inference has been too widely accepted that because the Communists have succeeded in building barricades across Berlin the free world must acquiesce in dismemberment of that living city So far as the record is concerned the Western powers have not acquiesced and should not do so Though Walter Ulbricht by grace of Soviet tanks may be head man in East Germany that does not give him any right to usurp the government of East Berlin or to absorb that semi-city into the Soviet zone The wartime protocol of September 12 1944 designated a special Greater Berlin area comprising the entire city to be under joint occupation It was not a part of any one of the three later four zones for occupation by Soviet American British and French troops respectively After the Berlin blockade and airlift the Council of Foreign Ministers in 1949 declared a purpose to mitigate the effects of the present administrative division of Germany and of Berlin For some time the Communists honored the distinction between the Soviet zone of Germany and the Soviet sector of Berlin by promulgating separately the laws for the two areas Then they moved offices of the East German puppet government into East Berlin and began illegally to treat it as the capital of East Germany That this and the closing of the East Berlin-West Berlin border have not been accepted by the Western governments appears in notes which Britain France and the United States sent to Moscow after the latter's gratuitous protest over a visit of Chancellor Adenauer and other West German officials to West Berlin The Chancellor had as much business there as Ulbricht had in East Berlin and was certainly less provocative than the juvenile sound-truck taunts of Gerhard Eisler The British and other replies to that Moscow note pointed out efforts of the Communist authorities to integrate East Berlin into East Germany by isolating it from the outside and attempting to make it the capital of East Germany They insisted on the fundamental fact that the whole of Berlin has a quadripartite status This is far from acknowledging or recognizing those efforts as an accomplished fact There remains of course the question of what the West can do beyond diplomatic protest to prevent the illegal efforts from becoming accomplished facts One ground of action certainly exists when fusillades of stray shots go over into West Berlin as Communist vopos try to gun down fleeing unarmed residents Another remained when an American Army car was recovered but with a broken glass The glass may seem trivial but Communist official hooliganism feeds on such incidents unless they are redressed Remembering the step-by-step fate of Danzig and the West German misgivings about salami tactics it is to be hoped that the dispatch of General Clay to West Berlin as President Kennedy's representative will mark a stiffening of response not only to future indignities and aggressions but also to some that have passed Prairie National Park Thousands of buffalo bison they will never be to the man on the street grazing like a mobile brown throw-rug upon the rolling dusty-green grassland A horizon even and seamless binding the vast sun-bleached dome of sky to earth That picture of the American prairie is as indelibly fixed in the memory of those who have studied the conquest of the American continent as any later cinema image of the West made in live-oak canyons near Hollywood For it was the millions of buffalo and prairie chicken and the endless seas of grass that symbolized for a whole generation of Americans the abundant supply that was to take many of them westward when the Ohio and Mississippi valleys began to fill The National Park Service now proposes to preserve an area in Pottawatomie County northeast Kansas as a Prairie National Park There the buffalo would roam to be seen as a tapestry not as moth-eaten zoo specimens Wooded stream valleys in the folds of earth would be saved Grasslands would extend unfenced unplowed unbroken by silo or barn as the first settlers saw them The Park Service makes an impressive ecological and statistical case for creating this new park American history should clinch the case when Congress is asked to approve Whisky on the air A Philadelphia distiller is currently breaching the customary prohibition against hard-liquor advertising on TV and radio Starting with small stations not members of the National Association of Broadcasters the firm apparently is seeking to break down the anti-liquor barriers in major-market stations Probably the best answer to this kind of entering wedge is congressional action requiring the Federal Communications Commission to ban such advertising through its licensing power The National Association of Broadcasters code specifically bars hard-liquor commercials Past polls of public opinion show popular favor for this policy Even the Distilled Spirits Institute has long had a specific prohibition Why then with these voluntary barricades and some state laws barring liquor ads is it necessary to seek congressional action Simply because the subverting action of firms that are not members of the Distilled Spirits Institute and of radio and TV stations that are not members of the NAB tends to spread Soon some members of the two industry groups doubtless will want to amend their codes on grounds that otherwise they will suffer unfairly from the efforts of non-code competitors Although the false glamour surrounding bourbon or other whisky commercials is possibly no more fatuous than the pseudo-sophistication with which TV soft-drinks are downed or toothpaste applied there is a sad difference between enticing a viewer into sipping Oopsie-Cola and gulling him into downing bourbon A law is needed New York Democrats' choice Registered Democrats in New York City this year have the opportunity to elect their party's candidates for Mayor and other municipal posts and the men who will run their party organization In the central contest that for Mayor they may have found some pertinent points in what each faction has said about the other Mayor Robert F. Wagner must as his opponents demand assume responsibility for his performance in office While all citizens share in blame for lax municipal ethics the Wagner regime has seen serious problems in the schools law enforcement and fiscal policies The Mayor is finding it awkward to campaign against his own record State Controller Arthur Levitt on the other hand cannot effectively deny that he has chosen to be the candidate of those party leaders who as a rule have shown livelier interest in political power than in the city's welfare They too have links with the city's ills Both men are known to be honest and public-spirited Mayor Wagner's shortcomings have perhaps been more mercilessly exposed than those of Mr. Levitt who left an impression of quiet competence in his more protected state post As Mayor Mr. Levitt might turn out to be more independent than some of his leading supporters would like His election on the other hand would unquestionably strengthen the regulars Mr. Wagner might or might not be a new Mayor in this third term now that he is free of the pressure of those party leaders whom he calls bosses These are of course the same people whose support he has only now rejected to seek the independent vote But his reelection would strengthen the liberal Democrats and the labor unions who back him If this choice is less exciting than New York Democrats may wish it nevertheless must be made The vote still gives citizens a voice in the operation of their government and their party Little war big test Both Mr. K's have so far continued to speak softly and carry big sticks over Laos President Kennedy already two quiet demands down still refused Thursday to be drawn into delivering a public ultimatum to Moscow But at the same time he moved his helicopter-borne marines to within an hour of the fighting And Secretary Rusk en route to Bangkok doubtless is trying to make emergency arrangements for the possible entry of Australian or Thai SEATO forces For Mr. Kennedy speaking softly and carrying a sizable stick is making the best of a bad situation The new President is in no position to start out his dealings with Moscow by issuing callable bluffs He must show at the outset that he means exactly what he says In this case he has put the alternatives clearly to Mr. Khrushchev for the third time At his press conference Mr. Kennedy said All we want in Laos is peace not war a truly neutral government not a cold war pawn At the scene he has just as clearly shown his military strength in unprovocative but ready position Since Laos is of no more purely military value to Moscow itself than it is to Washington this approach might be expected to head off Mr. Khrushchev for the moment But because of the peculiar nature of the military situation in Laos the Soviet leader must be tempted to let things ride a course that would appear to cost him little on the spot but would bog Washington in a tactical mess As wars go Laos is an extremely little one Casualties have been running about a dozen men a day The hard core of the pro-Communist rebel force numbers only some 2,000 tough Viet Minh guerrilla fighters But for the United States and its SEATO allies to attempt to shore up a less tough less combat-tested government army in monsoon-shrouded road-shy guerrilla-th'-wisp terrain is a risk not savored by Pentagon planners But if anything can bring home to Mr. Khrushchev the idea that he will not really get much enjoyment from watching this Braddock-against-the-Indians contest it will probably be the fact that SEATO forces are ready to attempt it plus the fact that Moscow has something to lose from closing off disarmament and other bigger negotiations with Washington Fortunately both the Republicans and America's chief Western allies now are joined behind the neutral Laos aim of the President Actually it would be more accurate to say that the leader of the alliance now has swung fully behind the British policy of seeking to achieve a neutral Laos via the international bargaining table It is ironic that Washington is having to struggle so for a concept that for six years it bypassed as unreasonable The State Department tacitly rejected the neutral Laos idea after the Geneva conference of 1954 and last year Washington backed the rightist coup that ousted neutral Premier Souvanna Phouma But since last fall the United States has been moving toward a pro-neutralist position and now is ready to back the British plan for a cease-fire patrolled by outside observers and followed by a conference of interested powers The road to a guaranteed-neutral coup-proof Laos is today almost as difficult as warfare on that nation's terrain But for the safety of Southeast Asia and for the sake of the Laotian people who would not be well-ruled by either militant minority now engaged in the fighting this last big effort to seal that country from the cold war had to be made The world awaits Mr. Khrushchev's choice of alternatives A vote for educational TV The Senate's overwhelming 64-13 vote to support locally controlled educational TV efforts should be emulated in the lower house Twice previously the Senate has approved measures backing ETV and the House has let them die But this year prospects may be better The House communications subcommittee is expected to report out a good bill calling for the states to match federal funds This year's Senate measure would provide each state and the District of Columbia with to be used in support of private state or municipal ETV efforts The funds would be used for equipment not for land buildings or operation The relatively few communities that have educational stations have found them of considerable value But lacking money from commercial sponsors the stations have had difficulties meeting expenses or improving their service Other communities the ones to be aided most by the Senate bill have had difficulty starting such stations because of the high initial cost of equipment A good man departs Goodby Mr. Sam Sam Rayburn was a good man a good American and third a good Democrat He was all of these rolled into one sturdy figure Mr. Speaker Mr. Sam and Mr. Democrat at one and the same time The House was his habitat and there he flourished first as a young representative then as a forceful committee chairman and finally in the post for which he seemed intended from birth Speaker of the House and second most powerful man in Washington Mr. Rayburn was not an easy man to classify or to label He was no flaming liberal yet the New Deal the Fair Deal and the New Frontier needed him He was not a rear-looking conservative yet partisans of that persuasion will miss him as much as any Two of the vital qualities demanded of a politician by other politicians are that he always keep a confidence and that he keep his word Sam Rayburn took unnumbered secrets with him to the grave for he was never loquacious and his word once given was not subject to retraction It might be added that as he kept his word so he expected that others keep theirs The demonstration of his power was never flamboyant or theatrical His leadership was not for audiences A growl a nod was usually enough When it was not one of the great dramas of Washington would be presented He would rise in the well of the House his chin upon his chest his hands gripping the side of a desk and the political and legislative chatter would subside into silence He spoke briefly sensibly to the point and without oratorical flourishes He made good plain American common sense and the House usually recognized it and acted upon it These public efforts were rare because Mr. Rayburn normally did his counseling persuading and educating long before an issue reached its test on the House floor He expected Democrats to do their duty when it had been patiently pointed out to them With his long service he had a long memory an excellent thing in a political leader He was of course in the House for a very long time There are only two men remaining in Congress who with Rayburn voted for the declaration of war against Germany in 1917 To almost two generations of Americans it must have seemed as though the existence of Mr. Sam coincided with that of the House And it was the House he loved To be presiding officer of it was the end of his desire and ambition The Senate to him was not the upper body and he corrected those who said he served under the president He served with him Sound the roll of those with whom he served and who preceded him in death Woodrow Wilson with whom he began his years in Washington Warren G. Harding Calvin Coolidge FDR with whom he managed a social revolution And those still with us Herbert C. Hoover Harry S. Truman Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy He was a fighter for those of his own party Mr. Truman has only to recall the hopeless campaign of 1948 to remember what a loyal partisan he was and the first experience of Mr. Kennedy with Congress would have been sadder than it was had not Mr. Sam been there As it was his absence because of his final illness was a blow to the administration With Republican presidents he fought fair He was his own man not an automatic obstructionist He kept his attacks on Republicanism for partisan campaigns but that is part of the game he was born to play Under any name Mr. Speaker Mr. Democrat Mr. Sam he was a good man un off the Congo track Thirteen Italian airmen who went to the Congo to serve the cause of peace under the United Nations banner have instead met violent death at the hands of Congolese troops supposedly their friends In 18 months no more grisly incident has been reported from that jungle Simply out of bloodlust their murderers dismembered the bodies and tossed the remains into the river The excuse was offered for them that they had mistaken the Italians for Belgian mercenaries In other words atrocities by savages wearing the uniform of the central government might be condoned had the victims been serving the cause of dissident Katanga Does this suggest that the Congo is fit for nationhood or that UN is making any progress whatever toward its goal of so making it To the contrary through the past six weeks violence has been piled upon violence Mass rapes troop mutinies uncontrolled looting and pillage and reckless military adventures given no sanction by any political authority have become almost daily occurrences Yet this basic condition of outlawry and anarchy is not the work of Katanga It happens in the territory of the Leopoldville government which is itself a fiction demonstrably incapable of governing and commanding only such limited credit abroad as UN support gives it The main question raised by the incident is how much longer will UN bury its head in the sand on the Congo problem instead of facing the bitter fact that it has no solution in present terms The probable answer is that it will do so just as long as Russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young African nations wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are visiting ruin on Central Africa Right now they are pushing a resolution which would have UN use its forces to invade and subjugate Katanga That notion is fantastically wrong-headed from several points of view The UN army is too weak too demoralized for the task Further it has its work cut out stopping anarchy where it is now garrisoned Last it makes no sense to deliver Katanga the one reasonably solid territory into the existing chaos The Congo should have been mandated because it was not ready for independence The idea was not even suggested because political expediency prevailed over wisdom It is perhaps too late now to talk of mandate because it is inconsistent with what is termed political realism But if any realism and feeling for truth remain in the General Assembly it is time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and urge some new approach Otherwise UN will march blindly on to certain defeat Featherbed reversal A recent editorial discussing a labor-management agreement reached between the Southern Pacific Co. and the Order of Railroad Telegraphers has been criticized on the grounds that it was not based on complete information The editorial was based on a news association dispatch which said that the telegraphers had secured an agreement whereby they were guaranteed 40 hours' pay per week whether they worked or not and that a reduction in their number was limited to 2 per cent per year Our comment was that this was featherbedding in its ultimate form and that sympathy for the railroad was misplaced since it had entered into such an agreement The statement was also made that undoubtedly the railroad had received some compensating benefit from the telegraphers but that it was difficult to imagine what could balance a job for life Additional information supplied to us discloses that the railroad gained a stabilized supply of telegraphers of which it was in need Also normal personnel attrition would make the job reduction provision more or less academic The situation with regard to the Southern Pacific was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable to other situations in other industries The solution reached in the agreement was more acceptable to the railroad than that originally included in a series of union demands Meditations from a fallout shelter Time was when the house of delegates of the American Bar association leaned to the common sense side But the internationalists have taken over the governing body of the bar and when the lads met in St. Louis it was not to grumble about the humidity but to vote unanimously that the United Nations was scarcely less than wonderful despite an imperfection here and there It was the brief writers decided man's best hope for a peaceful and law abiding world Peace it's wonderful and world law it's wonderful too and shouldn't we get an international covenant extending it into space before the Russians put some claim jumper on the moon Meanwhile in Moscow Khrushchev was adding his bit to the march of world law by promising to build a bomb with a wallop equal to 100 million tons of TNT to knock sense into the heads of those backward oafs who can't see the justice of surrendering West Berlin to communism A nuclear pacifier of these dimensions roughly some six and a half times bigger than anything the United States has triggered experimentally would certainly produce a bigger bang and just for kicks Khrushchev might use it to propel the seminar of the house of delegates from St. Louis to the moon where there wouldn't even be any beer to drink While he was at it the philosopher of the Kremlin contributed an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellowing at those in the west who can't appreciate coexistence thru suicide Fools he bayed what do you think you are doing The only response we can think of is the humble one that at least we aren't playing the marimba with our shoes in the United Nations but perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this feeble effort Another evidence of the spreading rule of reason was provided from Mexico City with the daily hijacking of an American plane by a demented Algerian with a gun The craft made the familiar unwelcome flight to Havana where for some unknown reason Castro rushed to the airport to express mortification to the Colombian foreign minister a passenger who is not an admirer of old Ten O'Clock Shadow The plane was sent back to the United States for a change but Castro kept the crazy gunman who will prove a suitable recruit to the revolution Less respect for the legal conventions was displayed by Castro's right hand man Che Guevara who edified the Inter-American Economic and Social council meeting in Montevideo by reading two secret American documents purloined from the United States embassy at Caracas Venezuela The contents were highly embarrassing to American spokesmen who were on hand to promise Latin Americans a 20 billion dollar foreign aid millennium Perhaps the moralities of world law are not advanced by stealing American diplomatic papers and planes but the Kennedy administration can always file a demurrer to the effect that but for its own incompetence in protecting American interests these things would not happen The same can be said about the half-hearted Cuban invasion mounted by the administration last April which we trust is not symptomatic of the methods to be invoked in holding off the felonious Khrushchev Pass the iron rations please and light another candle for it's getting dark down here and we're minded to read a bit of world law just to pass the time away The customer loses again The board of suspension of the Interstate Commerce commission has ordered a group of railroads not to reduce their freight rates on grain as they had planned to do this month The request for lower rates originated with the Southern railway which has spent a good deal of time and money developing a 100-ton hopper car with which it says it can move grain at about half what it costs in the conventional smaller car By reducing rates as much as 60 per cent it and its associated railroads hope to win back some of the business they have lost to truckers and barge lines The board's action shows what free enterprise is up against in our complex maze of regulatory laws A shock wave from Africa Word of Dag Hammarskjold's death in an African plane crash has sent a shockwave around the globe As head of the United Nations he was the symbol of world peace and his tragic end came at a moment when peace hangs precariously It was on the eve of a momentous U.N. session to come to grips with cold war issues His firm hand will be desperately missed Mr. Hammarskjold was in Africa on a mission of peace He had sought talks with Moise Tshombe the secessionist president of Congo's Katanga province where recent fighting had been bloody He earnestly urged a cease-fire The story of the fatal crash is not fully known The U.N.-chartered plane which was flying from the conference city of Ndola in Northern Rhodesia had been riddled with machinegun bullets last weekend and was newly repaired Whether this or overt action was the cause of the crash must be promptly determined The death of Mr. Hammarskjold removes the United Nations' most controversial leader He was controversial because he was uncompromising for peace and freedom with justice He courageously defended the rights of small nations and he stood his ground against the savage attacks of the Communist bloc The Congo in whose cause he died was the scene of one of his greatest triumphs His policies had resolved the conflicts that threatened to ignite the cold war and workable solutions were beginning to take shape When the recent Katangan outbreaks imperiled these solutions Mr. Hammarskjold despite the danger flew to exert a calming influence He gave his life for his beliefs The U.N. session scheduled for today will meet under the cloud of his passing It is a crucial session with the world on the edge of momentous developments If the manner of his passing moves the nations to act in the spirit of his dedication the sore issues that plague the world can yet be resolved with reason and justice That is the hope of mankind Monument to togetherness reaching agreement on projects of value to the whole community has long been one of Greater Miami's hardest tasks Too many have bogged down in bickering Even when public bodies arrived at a consensus at least one dissenting vote has been usual So we note approvingly a fresh sample of unanimity All nine members of the Inter-American Center Authority voted for Goodbody Company's proposal to finance the long-awaited trade and cultural center The widely known financial firm has 60 days to spell out the terms of its contract If the indenture is accepted the authority will proceed to validate a bond issue repayable from revenue Then Goodbody will hand over a minimum of million for developing the spacious Graves Tract to house the center The next step awaits approval today by the Metro commissioners as the members of the Dade County Port Authority They allotted three years ago to support Interama until its own financing could be arranged Less than half the sum has been spent since the Interama board pinched pennies during that period of painstaking negotiations The balance is being budgeted for the coming year Unanimity on Interama is not surprising It is one of the rare public ventures here on which nearly everyone is agreed The City of Miami recently yielded a prior claim of million on the Graves Tract to clear the way for the project County officials have cooperated consistently So have the people's elected spokesmen at the state and federal levels Interama as it rises will be a living monument to Greater Miami's ability to get together on worthwhile enterprises A short report and a good one progress or lack of it toward civil rights in the 50 states is reported in an impressive 689-page compilation issued last week by the United States Commission on Civil Rights Much happened in this field during the past 12 months Each state advisory committee documented its own activity Some accounts are quite lengthy but Florida's is the shortest of all requiring only four paragraphs The established pattern of relative calm in the field of race relations has continued in all areas reported this group headed by Harold Colee of Jacksonville and including two South Floridians William D. Singer and John B. Turner of Miami No complaints or charges have been filed during the past year either verbally or written from any individual or group The committee continues to feel that Florida has progressed in a sound and equitable program at both the state and local levels in its efforts to review and assess transition problems as they arise from time to time in the entire spectrum of civil rights Problems have arisen in this sensitive field but have been handled in most cases with understanding and restraint The progress reported by the advisory committee is real While some think we move too fast and others too slowly Florida's record is a good one and stands out among the 50 West Germany remains Western West Germany will face the crucial tests that lie ahead on Berlin and unification with a coalition government This is the key fact emerging from Sunday's national election Chancellor Adenauer's Christian Democratic Party slipped only a little in the voting but it was enough to lose the absolute Bundestag majority it has enjoyed since 1957 In order to form a new government it must deal with one of the two rival parties which gained strength Inevitably this means some compromise The aging chancellor in all likelihood will be retired Both Willy Brandt's Social Democrats who gained 22 seats in the new parliament and the Free Democrats who picked up 23 will insist on that before they enter the government Moon-faced Ludwig Erhart the economic expert probably will ascend to the leadership long denied him If he becomes chancellor Dr. Erhart would make few changes The wizard who fashioned West Germany's astonishing industrial rebirth is the soul of free enterprise He is dedicated to building the nation's strength and as are all West Germans to a free Berlin and to reunion with captive East Germany What is in doubt as the free Germans and their allies consider the voting trends is the nature of the coalition that will result If the party of Adenauer and Erhart with 45 per cent of the vote approaches the party of Willy Brandt which won 36 per cent the result would be a stiffening of the old resolve West Berlin's Mayor Brandt vigorously demanded a firmer stand on the dismemberment of his city and won votes by it The Free Democrats 12 per cent of the vote believe a nuclear war can be avoided by negotiating with the Soviet Union and more dealings with the Communist bloc The question left by the election is whether West Germany veers slightly toward more firmness or more flexibility It could go either way since the gains for both points of view were about the same Regardless of the decision two facts are clear West Germany with its industrial and military might reaffirmed its democracy and remains firm with the free nations And the career of Konrad Adenauer who upheld Germany's tradition of rock-like leaders which Bismarck began draws near the end Better ask before joining Americans are a nation of joiners a quality which our friends find endearing and sometimes amusing But it can be dangerous if the joiner doesn't want to make a spectacle of himself For instance so-called conservative organizations some of them secret are sprouting in the garden of joining where liberal organizations once took root One specific example is a secret fraternity which will coordinate anti-Communist efforts The principle is commendable but we suspect that in the practice somebody is going to get gulled According to The Chicago Tribune News Service State Atty. Gen. Stanley Mosk of California has devised a series of questions which the joiner might well ask about any organization seeking his money and his name 1 Does it assail schools and churches with blanket accusations 2 Does it attack other traditional American institutions with unsupportable and wild charges 3 Does it put the label of un-American or subversive on everyone with whom it disagrees politically 4 Does it attempt to rewrite modern history by blaming American statesmen for wars Communism depression and other troubles of the world 5 Does it employ crude pressure tactics with such means as anonymous telephone calls and letter writing campaigns 6 Do its spokesmen seem more interested in the amount of money they collect than in the principles they purport to advocate In some instances a seventh question can be added 7 Does the organization show an affinity for a foreign government political party or personality in opposition or preference to the American system If the would-be joiner asks these questions he is not likely to be duped by extremists who are seeking to capitalize on the confusions and the patriotic apprehensions of Americans in a troubled time Falling somewhere in a category between Einstein's theory and sand fleas difficult to see but undeniably there nevertheless is the tropical green city of Islandia a string of offshore islands that has almost no residents limited access and an unlimited future The latter is what concerns us all Whatever land you can see here from the North tip end of Elliott Key looking southward belongs to someone people who have title to the land And what you can't see the land underneath the water belongs to someone too The public The only real problem is to devise a plan whereby the owners of the above-water land can develop their property without the public losing its underwater land and the right to its development for public use and enjoyment In the fairly brief but hectic history of Florida the developers of waterfront land have too often wound up with both their land and ours In this instance happily insistence is being made that our share is protected And until this protection is at least as concrete as say the row of hotels that bars us from our own sands at Miami Beach those who represent us all should agree to nothing Closed doors in city hall The reaction of certain City Council members to California's newest anti-secrecy laws was as dismaying as it was disappointing We had assumed that at least this local legislative body had nothing to hide and therefore had no objections to making the deliberations of its committees and the city commissions available to the public In the preamble to the open-meeting statutes collectively known as the Brown Act the Legislature declares that the public commissions boards and councils and other public agencies in this state exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business It is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them The people in delegating authority do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know The full implementation of these noble words however has taken the efforts of five sessions of the Legislature Since 1953 California has led the nation in enacting guarantees that public business shall be publicly conducted but not until this year did the lawmakers in Sacramento plug the remaining loopholes in the Brown Act Despite the lip service paid by local governments the anti-secrecy statutes have been continuously subverted by reservations and rationalizations When all else fails it is argued that open sessions slow down governmental operations We submit that this is a most desirable effect of the law and one of its principal aims Without public scrutiny the deliberations of public agencies would no doubt be conducted more speedily But the citizens would of course never be sure that the decisions that resulted were as correct as they were expeditious Help when needed If the Dominican Republic achieves free democratic government it will be due in large part to the U.S. show of force that enabled President Balaguer to prevent a threatened restoration of Trujillo dictatorship Outwardly Ciudad Trujillo is calm None of the Trujillo family remains Mr. Balaguer is in control and opposition leaders have no further excuse to suspect his offer of a coalition government preliminary to free elections in the spring Had U.S. warships not appeared off the Dominican coast there is every possibility that the country would now be wracked by civil war Ultimately either the Trujillos would have been returned to power or the conflict would have produced conditions favorable to a takeover by Dominican elements responsive to Castro in Cuba Within the Organization of American States there may be some criticism of this unilateral American intervention which was not without risk obviously But there was no complaint from the Dominican crowds which lined Ciudad Trujillo's waterfront shouting Vive Yankees More the U.S. action was hailed by a principal opposition leader Dr. Juan Bosch as having saved many lives and many troubles in the near future Mr. Balaguer's troubles are by no means over He will need the help of all OAS members to eradicate finally the forces of authoritarianism pro-Trujillo and pro-Castro alike In cooperating toward that objective OAS might move with the speed and effectiveness demonstrated by the United States Matter of survival those watching the growing rivalry between craft unions and industrial unions may recognize all the pressures that led to the big labor split in 1935 Now as then it is a matter of jobs Craft unions seek work that industrial unions claim such as factory maintenance The issue was sufficiently potent in 1935 to spark secession from the American Federation of Labor of its industrial union members That breach was healed 20 years later by merger of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations Or that's what it looked like at the time But automation and the increasing complexity of factories has renewed the competition for jobs Walter Reuther leader of the industrial union faction of the AFL-CIO says another two years of this squabbling will be disastrous for all American labor Whether it could be as disastrous for American labor as say Jimmy Hoffa of the Teamsters is a matter of conjecture But the jurisdictional disputes that result from the craft-industrial rivalry do not win friends for labor Engaged as it is in a battle for world trade as a condition of national survival this country can have little patience with labor's family feuds The concept of labor as a special class is outmoded and in the task confronting America as bastion of the free world labor must learn to put the national interest first if it is itself to survive Deterrent the Army Navy and Air Force among others may question Secretary Freeman's claim that the high estate of United States agriculture is the strongest deterrent to the spread of communism But the secretary insists that the success of the American farmer is the greatest single source of strength in the struggle to insure freedom around the world Mr. Freeman said that in many of the countries he visited on a recent world trade trip people were more awed by America's capacity to produce food surpluses than by our industrial production or even by the Soviet's successes in space This shouldn't surprise the secretary American taxpayers have been impressed by the surpluses for a long long time In fact over the years the American farmer's capacity to over-produce has cost the taxpayers a large dollar And thus far Mr. Freeman has offered very little relief The 1961 feed grain program which the secretary sponsored has been declared a billion dollar fiasco In exchange for higher price supports growers pledged reduction in planted acreage But the farmers outsmarted Washington by shortening the distance between the rows and pouring on the fertilizer The result billion added to the deficit in the federal budget Perhaps as Mr. Freeman says American agriculture may stop the Communists but it is also swindling the American taxpayer What's wrong at state A senate subcommittee headed by Sen. Jackson of Washington has been going over the State Department and has reached some predictable conclusions The department needs a clearer sense of direction at the top and it needs fewer but better people Sen. Jackson says The subcommittee is not alone in questioning the effectiveness of the department President Kennedy has indicated his dissatisfaction with its performance But those who would revitalize so complex an organization must first of all overcome the resistance of layers of officials wedded to traditional procedures suspicious of innovation and fearful of mistakes Nor does Sen. Jackson discuss the delicate situation created by the presence in the White House of a corps of presidential assistants engaged in the study of foreign policy This tends to create friction and confusion and has not made it easier for Secretary Rusk to restore vigor and initiative among his subordinates But competent observers believe he is making progress particularly toward what Sen. Jackson lists as the primary need a clearer understanding of where our vital national interests lie and what we must do to promote them The Jackson report will provide some of the political support Mr. Rusk will need if he is to get rid of department personnel engaged as Sen. Jackson puts it in work that does not really need doing Mr. Rusk should also draw comfort from Sen. Jackson's recommendation that congressional methods of dealing with national security problems be improved Self-criticism is a rare but needed commodity in Congress Betting men forecasting economic activity is a hazardous undertaking even for the specialist But now apparently the job of Secretary of Labor requires that he be willing to risk his reputation as a prognosticator of unemployment trends James P. Mitchell when he was the head of the department promised to eat his hat if unemployment didn't drop below three million a couple of years ago He lost but settled for a cake in the shape of a fedora His successor Secretary Goldberg also has been guessing wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which has been holding just under 7 per cent for the last 11 months No betting man Mr. Goldberg says he's merely putting my neck out again by predicting the rate will go down this month He is basing his guess on new government statistics that show business has broadened its stride a new record high in personal income an increase in housing starts a spurt in retail sales and a gain in orders for durable goods Mr. Mitchell had an excuse for losing the steel strike lasted much longer than he anticipated Mr. Goldberg has less reason for missing The economy seems to be sailing along on an even keel and the 1961 hurricane season and auto strikes are at an end so they can't be blamed in November The odds thus appear favorable that the secretary's neck may be spared Little resistance Cambodia's chief of state who has been accused of harboring Communist marauders and otherwise making life miserable for neighboring South Viet Nam and Thailand insists he would be very unhappy if communism established its power in Southeast Asia But so convinced of communism's inevitable triumph is Prince Sihanouk that he is ready to throw in the towel I have to see the facts is the way the prince puts it And from that point of vantage he concedes another two years of grace to nations maintaining a pro-Western posture Prince Sihanouk's powers of prognostication some day may be confirmed but history is not likely to praise the courage of his convictions Bottom sighted Commerce Secretary Hodges seems to have been cast in the role of pacemaker for official Washington's economic forecasters Weeks ago he saw a business upturn in the second quarter of this year while his colleagues in the Cabinet were shaking their heads in disagreement Recently Treasury Secretary Dillon and Labor Secretary Goldberg fell into line with Mr. Hodges' appraisal though there has been some reluctance to do so at the White House And now Mr. Hodges has pioneered further into the economic unknown with the announcement that he thinks business has stopped sliding and that it should start going upward from this point He is the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the slump The secretary based his assessment on the upturn in retail sales February's volume was 1 per cent above January's for the first pickup since last October although it's still 1.5 per cent off from February 1960 Corroborating Mr. Hodges' figures was the Federal Reserve Board's report of the large sales increase in the nation's department stores for the week ending March 4 In Newark for example this gain was put at 26 per cent above the year-earlier level Of course some of the credit for the sale boost must be given to improvement in the weather and to the fact that Easter comes more than two weeks earlier than in 1960 Another optimistic sign this one from the Labor Department was the report that the long rise in unemployment compensation payments was interrupted for the first time in the week ending Feb. 25 Initial claims for jobless benefits were said to have dropped by 8,100 in the week ending March 4 Mr. Hodges is so hopeful over the outlook that he doesn't think there will be any need of a cut in income taxes Well we can't have everything Prosperity for the whole nation is certainly preferred to a tax cut In New Jersey too New Jersey folk need not be told of the builder's march to the sea for in a single generation he has parceled and populated miles of our shoreline and presses on to develop the few open spaces that remain Now the Stone Harbor bird sanctuary 31 acres of magic attraction for exotic herons is threatened but the battlefront extends far beyond our state Against the dramatic fight being waged for preservation of 30 miles of Cape Cod shoreline the tiny tract at Stone Harbor may seem unimportant But Interior Secretary Udall warns that there is a race on between those who would develop our few surviving open shorelines and those who would save them for the enjoyment of all as public preserves The move for establishment of a national seashore park on 30,000 acres of Cape Cod from Provincetown to Chatham is strengthened by President Kennedy's interest in that area But preservation of the natural beauty of the Cape is of more than regional concern for the automobile age has made it the recreation spot of people from all over the country By comparison Stone Harbor bird sanctuary's allies seem less formidable for aside from the Audubon Society they are mostly the snowy common and cattle egrets and the Louisiana green little blue and black-crowned herons who nest and feed there But there is hope for Conservation Commissioner Bontempo has tagged the sanctuary as the kind of place the state hopes to include in its program to double its park space The desirability of preserving such places as the Cape dunes and Stone Harbor sanctuary becomes more apparent every year Public sentiment for conserving our rich natural heritage is growing But that heritage is shrinking even faster No joyride much of the glamor President Kennedy's Peace Corps may have held for some prospective applicants has been removed by Sargent Shriver the head corpsman Anybody who is expecting a joyride should according to Mr. Shriver get off the train right now First of all the recruits will have to undergo arduous schooling It will be a 16-hour training day Then off to a remote place in an underdeveloped country where the diet culture language and living conditions will be different And the pay of course will be nil Despite all this the idea apparently has captured the imagination of countless youths whose parents are probably more surprised by the response than anybody else The study of the St. Louis area's economic prospects prepared for the Construction Industry Joint Conference confirms and reinforces both the findings of the Metropolitan St. Louis Survey of 1957 and the easily observed picture of the Missouri-Illinois countryside St. Louis sits in the center of a relatively slow-growing and in some places stagnant mid-continent region Slackened regional demand for St. Louis goods and services reflects the region's relative lack of purchasing power Not all St. Louis industries of course have a market area confined to the immediate neighborhood But for those which do the slow growth of the area has a retarding effect on the metropolitan core The city has a stake in stimulating growth and purchasing power throughout outstate Missouri and Southern Illinois Gov. Dalton's New Commerce and Industry Commission is moving to create a nine-state regional group in a collective effort to attract new industry That is one approach Another would be to take the advice of Dr. Elmer Ellis president of the University of Missouri and provide for an impartial professional analysis of Missouri's economy He says the state in order to proceed with economic development must develop an understanding of how the various parts of its economy fit together and dovetail into the national economy The research center of the University's School of Business and Public Administration is prepared to undertake the analysis Dr. Ellis has been talking about He and Dean John W. Schwada of the Business School outlined the project at a recent conference The University can make a valuable contribution to the state's economic development through such a study In Southern Illinois the new federal program of help to economically depressed areas ought to provide some stimulus to growth The Carbondale Industrial Development Corp. has obtained a loan to help defray the cost of remodeling a city-owned factory to accommodate production that will provide 500 new jobs Carbondale is in the Herrin-Murphysboro-West Frankfort labor market where unemployment has been substantially higher than the national average The Federal program eventually should have a favorable impact on Missouri's depressed areas and in the long run that will benefit St. Louis as well Politics-ridden St. Clair county in Illinois presents another piece of the problem of metropolitan development More industrial acreage lies vacant in St. Clair county than in any other jurisdiction in the St. Louis area The unstable political situation there represents one reason new plants shy away from the East Side And then there is St. Louis county where the Democratic leadership has shown little appreciation of the need for sound zoning of the important relationship between proper land use and economic growth St. Louis county under its present leadership also has largely closed its eyes to the need for governmental reform and permitted parochial interests to take priority over area-wide interests Some plant-location specialists take these signs to mean St. Louis county doesn't want industry and so they avoid the area and more jobs are lost Metropolitan St. Louis's relatively slow rate of growth ought to be a priority concern of the political business civic and other leaders on both sides of the Mississippi Without a great acceleration in the metropolitan area's economy there will not be sufficient jobs for the growing numbers of youngsters and St. Louis will slip into second-class status An excess of zeal Many of our very best friends are reformers Still we must confess that sometimes some of them go too far Take for example the reformers among New York City's Democrats Having whipped Mr. De Sapio in the primaries and thus come into control of Tammany Hall they have changed the name to Chatham Hall Even though headquarters actually have been moved into the Chatham building do they believe that they can make the new name stick Granted that the Tammany name and the Tammany tiger often were regarded as badges of political shame the sachems of the Hall also have a few good marks to their credit But it is tradition rather than the record which balks at the expunging of the Tammany name After all it goes back to the days in which sedition was not un-American the days in which the Sons of St. Tammany conspired to overthrow the government by force and violence the British government that is Further do our reforming friends really believe that the cartoonists will consent to the banishment of the tiger from their zoo They will when they give up the donkey and the elephant Instead of attempting the impossible why not a publicity campaign to prove that all the tiger's stripes are not black That might go over The Faget case The White House itself has taken steps to remove a former Batista official Col. Mariano Faget from his preposterous position as interrogator of Cuban refugees for the Immigration Service The Faget appointment was preposterous on several grounds The Kennedy Administration had assured anti-Castro Cubans that it would have nothing to do with associates of Dictator Batista Using a Batista man to screen refugees represented a total misunderstanding of the democratic forces which alone can effectively oppose Castro Moreover Col. Faget's information on Cuba was too outdated to be useful in screening Castro agents the Colonel fled to the friendly haven of the Dominican dictatorship as soon as Castro seized power And while he had headed Batista's anti-Communist section the Batista regime did not disturb the Communists so much as more open opponents who were alleged to be Communists Responsibility for the Faget appointment rests with Gen. J. M. Swing an Eisenhower appointee as head of the Immigration Service Gen. Swing has received public attention before this for abuse of some of the prerogatives of his office His official term expired last summer Some reports say he was rescued from timely retirement by his friend Congressman Walter of Pennsylvania at a moment when the Kennedy Administration was diligently searching for all the House votes it could get Congressman Walter has been all-powerful in immigration matters but he has announced plans to retire in 1962 At that point the Administration will have little reason to hang onto Gen. Swing The Faget case was the kind of salvage job the Administration should not have to repeat Mr. Eisenhower politician As President Dwight D. Eisenhower often assumed a role aloof from the strife of partisan politics As a former President however Mr. Eisenhower abandoned this role to engage in partisan sniping during a New York Republican rally and generally missed his target Mr. Eisenhower seized upon the incident of the postcard lost by a Peace Corps girl in Nigeria to attack the entire Corps as a juvenile experiment and to suggest sending a Corps member to the moon This was juvenile ridicule Nowhere did the speaker recognize the serious purpose of the Corps or its welcome reception abroad His words were the more ungracious to come from a man who lent his name to the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships dedicated to the same goal of international understanding The former President blithely ignored recent history in speaking of dollarette dollars under Kennedy Administration fiscal policies It was the Eisenhower Administration which produced the largest peacetime deficit Finally Mr. Eisenhower found nothing but confusion in Washington This statement recalls the 1959 Berlin crisis when President Eisenhower first told reporters that Berlin could not be defended with conventional weapons and then added that a nuclear defense was out of the picture too The crisis has been renewed since then but the confusion has hardly been compounded Ex-Presidents relieved of accountability for policy sometimes seem to feel free of accountability for their words Some of former President Truman's off-the-cuff discourses have been in that vein Nobody can deny the right of former Chief Executives to take part in politics but the American people expect them always to remember the obligations of national leadership and to treat issues with a sense of responsibility This is a matter of respect for the Presidency Mr. Eisenhower's New York speech does not encourage respect for that or for his elder statesmanship Queen of the seas The Queen Mary has long been a symbol of speed luxury and impeccable British service on the high seas Reports that the venerable liner which has been in service since 1936 was to be retired struck a nostalgic note in many of us But the Cunard line influenced by unpleasant economic facts and not sentiment has decided to keep the Queen Mary in service until next Spring at least A new queen with the prosaic title of Q3 had been planned for several years to replace the Queen Mary The British government concerned about the threat of unemployment in the shipbuilding industry had put through a bill to give Cunard loans and grants totaling toward the cost of a new 75,000-ton passenger liner Since 1957 more and more trans-Atlantic passengers have been crossing by air Economy class fares and charter flights have attracted almost all new passengers to the airlines Competition from other steamship lines has cut Cunard's share of sea passengers from one-third to one-fourth and this year the line showed a marked drop of profits on the Atlantic run The Cunard line has under consideration replacing the Queen Mary with a ship smaller than 75,000 tons This would be cheaper to operate and could be used for cruises during the lean winter months Also under consideration
